For the genetic mechanismshe most important causal processes in this category are (i)  horizontal gene transfer, (ii) gain of function mutations, (iii) loss-offunction mutations. 

Genetic mechanisms represent the most straightforward source of variation, where heritable mutations lead to gain or loss of function or horizontal gene transfer introduces new capabilities [@giri2019]. These changes create subpopulations with distinct functional profiles that can persist over varying timescales depending on selective pressures [@cyriaque2024]. en plus des mecanismes qui peuvent entrain gain-of-function mutations comme new metabolic pathways or resistance mechanisme, where novel capabilities are acquired through genetic change introducing ms.The most important causal processes in this category include: loss-of-function mutations, where genes are inactivated or down-regulated, creating dependencies on other organisms that can provide the missing functions;  A particularly striking example involves auxotrophic bacteria - organisms that have lost genes coding for essential molecules through mutations. These mutants can survive by relying on helper organisms that provide the missing compounds [@pande2014; @morris2012]. While this creates dependency, it also reduces metabolic costs and enables specialization within the population, allowing different mutants to thrive collectively in challenging environments. The stability and maintenance of these subpopulations depends on the strength of selective pressures in their environment.

However, genetic variation is not the only driver of functional specialization. Gene expression-based mechanisms involve more complex regulation of protein synthesis and can create transient or reversible[@dekkers1998] functional specialization that may eventually become genetically encoded. Random fluctuations in gene expression due to the inherent noise [@raj2008; @chowdhury2021; @keren2015] in biological systems can lead to phenotypic heterogeneity even among genetically identical cells. This noise-driven variation can create functional diversity that benefits the population as a whole. Building upon this concept, the novel theory of noise-averaging cooperation (NAC)[@lopez2022] explains how stochastic metabolic noise can drive the emergence of cross-feeding interactions and metabolic interdependencies. Due to their small size, bacteria experience substantial noise in metabolic regulation, which limits individual growth rates. To compensate, related bacteria can share metabolites to 'average out' this noise and improve collective growth. This metabolite sharing, or 'leakage', can then facilitate the evolution of metabolic interdependencies and even drive speciation through gene deletions, as predicted by the Black Queen Hypothesis [@morris2012]. The Black Queen Hypothesis, proposed by Morris and colleagues, suggests that in environments where certain functions are costly to maintain but beneficial to the community, some organisms may lose these functions (becoming "leaky") while others retain them, creating metabolic interdependencies. NAC thus provides a mechanistic link between stochastic gene expression noise and the emergence of genetic specialization within populations, bridging the gap between phenotypic and genetic mechanisms of variation.

Environmental regulation further complicates this picture, as differential gene expression driven by microenvironmental cues and cellular perception of local conditions [@korshoj2024] can create spatial or temporal patterns of functional specialization within populations. These environmentally-induced variations can become stabilized through genetic changes if they confer consistent fitness benefits, illustrating how phenotypic plasticity can drive evolutionary innovation.

These mechanisms often interact and overlap, making it challenging to distinguish between them. Factors such as growth/defense trade-offs, physiological state, growth stage, and even cell lysis can contribute to functional heterogeneity within populations. Importantly, phenotypic variation can provide the substrate for genetic evolution - stochastic gene expression patterns that confer fitness benefits may become stabilized through genetic changes over time. This evolutionary perspective highlights how the division of labor within populations can emerge through a complex interplay of immediate phenotypic responses and long-term genetic adaptation. The resolution of measurement techniques and the capacity to detect variation between cells (now possible with single-cell technologies) are crucial for understanding these complex interactions and their evolutionary implications.

The root environment presents unique challenges and opportunities for bacterial colonization. The rhizosphere, the soil region directly influenced by root exudates, represents a nutrient-rich but competitive environment where bacteria must balance resource acquisition with defense against competitors. This complex ecosystem provides an ideal setting for studying how bacterial populations adapt through functional specialization and metabolic cooperation.

## Model Organism: Pseudomonas brassicacearum R401

Successful establishment of bacteria at roots is driven by multiple independent biological processes involved in both host-microbe (i.e., signal recognition, chemotaxis, surface attachment, biofilm formation, virulence factors) and microbe-microbe interactions (i.e., production of antimicrobials or public goods) (Knights et al. 2021). Therefore, we postulate that the simultaneous activation of these diverse processes is costly and that cooperation between genetically identical strains is key for promoting bacterial pervasiveness at roots. Consistent with this hypothesis, we recently demonstrated that the robust root coloniser Pseudomonas brassicacearum R401 (hereafter referred to as PsR401) deploys multiple independent strategies that co-function to promote colonisation and persistence at roots (Getzke et al., 2023). Notably, we identified two independent processes involved in microbe-microbe competition – namely the production of an antimicrobial and of a molecule scavenging the micronutrient iron – that act additively to promote strain competitiveness at roots (Getzke et al., 2023). We identified a third bacterial locus in PsR401 involved in the production of a phytotoxin that promotes both pathogenicity and root colonisation in mono-association experiments with A. thaliana (unpublished, see below). Our work provides proof-of-concept data illustrating that PsR401 deploys diverse exo-metabolites during root microbiota establishment that have versatile functions in host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions. Together with earlier work (Gu et al. 2020, Harbort et al 2020), it also delineates iron as a major micronutrient modulating strain competitiveness and proliferation at roots. Given that the public good iron becomes rate-limiting in the root compartment and that production of the above-mentioned processes are all modulated by iron availability (Lim et al., 2012; Palma et al., 2003, Mo et al. 1991), we anticipate that division of labour between bacterial intra-populations is bolstered under iron limiting conditions such as those found in the root habitat.

Our study focuses on *Pseudomonas brassicacearum* R401 (PsR401), a robust root colonizer of *Arabidopsis thaliana* that can act as an opportunistic pathogen. This strain represents an excellent model for studying intraspecific DOL due to its complex colonization strategies and environmental adaptability.

### Colonization Strategies

PsR401 deploys multiple independent strategies for root colonization and persistence:

-   **Antimicrobial production**: Suppresses competitors in the rhizosphere
-   **Siderophore production**: Enhances iron acquisition and competitiveness by sequestering iron
-   **Phytotoxin production**: Promotes both pathogenicity and root colonization

### Iron as a Key Limiting Factor

These processes are all modulated by iron availability, which becomes rate-limiting in the root compartment. Iron acts as a "public good" in the rhizosphere - all bacteria require it, but it is scarce in the environment. Given that the production of antimicrobials, siderophores, and phytotoxines is energetically costly and iron-dependent, we hypothesize that division of labor between bacterial intra-populations is bolstered under iron-limiting conditions.

## Single-Cell Technologies: Unveiling Cellular Heterogeneity

Single-cell technologies have revolutionized our understanding of cellular diversity in eukaryotic systems. Methods such as scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, scMetabolomics, and spatial omics have provided unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity and functional specialization. These new technologies allow us to access within-species diversity and study the possible metabolic specialization between cells. Single-cell omics have been developed for this purpose in human health and are now applied to microbial systems. However, analyzing such datasets still requires custom pipelines to respond to the specificity of bacterial biology and technical challenges.

### Technical Challenges in Bacterial Single-Cell RNA-seq

However, applying these technologies to bacterial systems presents unique challenges:

-   **Lack of poly-A tails**: Bacterial mRNAs lack poly-A tails, requiring alternative capture methods
-   **High rRNA content**: rRNA constitutes up to 95% of bacterial RNA, necessitating effective depletion strategies
-   **Low RNA content**: Bacterial cells contain much less RNA than mammalian cells
-   **Cell wall complexity**: Diverse cell wall structures complicate RNA extraction
-   **Operon structure**: Bacterial operons require specific approaches for complete capture
-   **Small RNA detection**: Regulatory sRNAs are challenging to detect due to their short length

### Methodological Approaches

Several approaches have been developed to address these challenges:

-   **Plate-based methods**: High sensitivity but low throughput (hundreds of cells)
-   **Split-pool barcoding**: High throughput with moderate sensitivity (microSPLiT)
-   **Droplet-based methods**: Balance between throughput and sensitivity

## Research Objectives and Experimental Approach

### Primary Research Question

The goal of this internship is to explore scRNA-seq (single-cell RNA-seq) datasets of *Pseudomonas brassicacearum*, a root colonizer. The student will analyze sample datasets from various nutritional conditions to determine if DOL can be detected within this species as a strategy for efficient root colonization.

The central question of this study is: **Is there functional specialization (DOL) within clonal populations of PsR401?**

This question addresses two main biological hypotheses:

1.  **Noisy regulation hypothesis**: Gene expression varies stochastically between identical cells
2.  **Specialized cells hypothesis**: Certain cells become functionally specialized under specific conditions

### Experimental Design

We employ the microSPLiT technology [@kuchina2021], a high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing method for bacteria developed from SPLiT-seq for eukaryotic cells. This method allows for the analysis of transcriptomic heterogeneity within bacterial populations at single-cell resolution, providing insights into gene expression patterns and cellular diversity that would be masked in bulk RNA-seq approaches.

The experimental setup includes: - **Controlled conditions**: Iron-limiting and glucose-limiting environments - **Time course analysis**: During exponential growth phase - **Multiple replicates**: Biological and technical replicates for robust analysis - **High-throughput sequencing**: Targeting \~3,000 cells with \~1.5 billion reads

This approach will provide mechanistic insights into whether and how a robust bacterial root colonizer can partition tasks within intra-populations to achieve greater functional diversity, minimize energetic costs, and adapt to environmental constraints.

The ANR DivIDE project seeks to understand the mechanisms of division of labor in bacterial populations, with WP2 focusing on transcriptional variation supporting intraspecific DOL. This internship represents a first approach to exploring these complex interactions at the single-cell level.
