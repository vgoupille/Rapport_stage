## Division of Labor: A Fundamental Biological Principle

The survival of organisms in evolving environments is driven by their fitness[^01-introduction-1], where the cost-benefit ratio of traits is constantly balanced and gives rise to different populational evolutionary strategies. To succeed, organisms must compete, cooperate, and/or specialize based on how well their traits enable resource acquisition and utilization in their biotic and abiotic environment. Division of Labor (DOL) represents one such strategy - the specialization of tasks of entities, optimizing resource use and enhancing collective performance [@cooper2018]. This fundamental principle operates throughout biological systems, from molecular evolution where gene duplication enables enzyme specialization, to multicellular organisms where cellular differentiation creates specialized tissues, to eusocial insect societies with their reproductive and functional caste systems [@giri2019]. Division of labour occurs when different individuals, cells or tissues become specialised to perform complementary tasks that benefit the whole organism or social group [@taborsky2025].

[^01-introduction-1]: Fitness refers to the ability of an organism to survive and reproduce in its environment, measured by its reproductive success and contribution to future generations.

## Division of Labor in Microbial Communities

Building upon these fundamental principles, microbial communities provide excellent examples of DOL in action. Giri and colleagues have attempted to define the concept of DOL specifically within microbial communities, identifying key criteria that distinguish true DOL from other types of ecological interactions [@giri2019]. Microbial interactions can be classified based on their directionality and the species involved (@fig-microbial-dol). Interactions can be unidirectional or bidirectional, and can occur within the same species (intraspecific) or between different species (interspecific). For an interaction to qualify as true DOL, it must involve reciprocal fitness benefits between partners, where both participants gain from the interaction. The figure below illustrates this distinction, showing how closed (reciprocal) interactions provide mutual fitness benefits, while open (linear) interactions represent parasitic or unidirectional relationships that do not qualify as DOL.

*Classification of pairwise and three-way interactions as DOL. Interactions can be uni- or bidirectional as well as occur within one or between two microbial species. Arrows indicate fitness benefits that are exchanged between interaction partners that can be direct (straight line) or indirect (dashed line). For an interaction to classify as DOL, four main criteria need to be fulfilled, which is only the case in closed (reciprocal) interactions (green), yet not in open (linear) interactions (red). (a) Mutually beneficial (reciprocal) interaction within two conspecific genotypes. (b) Mutually beneficial (reciprocal) interaction within two heterospecific genotypes. (c) Mutually beneficial (reciprocal) interaction between three different species. (d) Unidirectional interaction between two members of the same species. (e) Unidirectional interaction between three members of three different species. (f) Unidirectional interaction between two members of two different species. (g) Unidirectional (linear) interaction chain between members of three different species.*

## Interspecific Division of Labor in Root Microbiota

Interspecific DOL has been well-characterized in various ecosystems, with numerous examples of cross-feeding and mutualistic interactions documented in the human gut microbiome and soil communities [@rafieenia2022].

The root microbiota represents a particularly well-studied example of interspecific DOL. Roots of healthy plants host diverse bacteria that are collectively referred to as the bacterial root microbiota. Unlike their multicellular eukaryotic hosts that evolved diverse cell-types to achieve distinct biological functions and promote a division of labour, unicellular organisms such as bacteria rely on metabolic exchange(s) with their surrounding biotic environment to establish and maintain their ecological niches. Recent reports [@mataigne2021; @mataigne2022], indicate that metabolic interdependencies and cross-feeding exchanges are widespread among taxonomically diverse bacteria and likely drive microbial co-existence within complex bacterial communities[@estrela2016; @adkins-jablonsky2021]

## Intraspecific Division of Labor: An Emerging Research Area

While interspecific DOL has been extensively studied in various ecosystems, intraspecific DOL within clonal bacterial populations remains less explored, despite its potential importance for understanding population-level adaptation and functional diversity. The traditional view of biological populations assumed that all individuals within a clonal population behave identically. However, evidence has accumulated over decades showing that even genetically identical organisms can exhibit functional heterogeneity, leading to population-level benefits through task specialization [@lópez-pagán2025]. While intraspecific division of labor has been well-documented in multicellular organisms and social insects, its study in bacterial populations represents a more recent and growing field of research.

## Sources of Variation in Intraspecific DOL

Intraspecific DOL emerges through diverse mechanisms that create functional specialization within populations (producing phenotypic heterogeneity). These mechanisms can be classified into three main categories: (1) coordinated specialization, where individuals coordinate to determine roles through signals, cues, or developmental programs; (2) random specialization, where each individual adopts a helper phenotype; and (3) genetic control, where phenotypic differences are determined by genetic variation between individuals [@cooper2022]. 

### Genetic Mechanisms

Genetic mechanisms represent the most straightforward source of variation, where heritable mutations lead to gain or loss of function or horizontal gene transfer introduces new capabilities [@giri2019]. These changes create subpopulations with distinct functional profiles that can persist over varying timescales depending on selective pressures [@cyriaque2024]. Genetic control of DOL can be achieved through two main pathways.

First, the acquisition of a novel phenotypic capability via gain-of-function mutations or horizontal gene transfer can enhance the production of a metabolite or enzyme that plays a role in synergistic interactions between two or more partners.

Second, mutations that inactivate or down-regulate genes can lead to synergistic interactions in the community. Mutants that have lost the ability to autonomously produce certain metabolites can be favored by natural selection when the loss is compensated by another member of the community. A particularly striking example involves auxotrophic bacteria - organisms that have lost genes coding for essential molecules through mutations, such as vitamins, amino acids, or other metabolites. These mutants can survive by relying on helper organisms that provide the missing compounds [@pande2014; @morris2012]. While this creates dependency, it also reduces metabolic costs and enables specialization within the population, allowing different mutants to thrive collectively in challenging environments.

The Black Queen Hypothesis (BQH), provides a theoretical framework that explains the evolution of such auxotrophic dependencies [@morris2012]. This hypothesis suggests that in environments where certain functions are costly to maintain but beneficial to the community, some organisms may lose these functions (becoming "leaky" or auxotrophic) while others retain them, creating metabolic interdependencies. Auxotrophic bacteria exemplify this principle perfectly - they have lost the ability to synthesize essential metabolites, becoming dependent on other community members that continue to produce and leak these compounds. This division of metabolic labor allows auxotrophs to reduce their metabolic burden while still benefiting from the essential compounds provided by their neighbors.

### Gene Expression-Based Mechanisms

#### Noise-Driven Mechanisms

However, genetic variation is not the only driver of functional specialization. Gene expression-based mechanisms involve more complex regulation of protein synthesis and can create transient or reversible [@dekkers1998] functional specialization that may eventually become genetically encoded. Random fluctuations in gene expression due to the inherent noise [@raj2008; @chowdhury2021; @keren2015] in biological systems can lead to phenotypic heterogeneity even among genetically identical cells. This noise-driven variation can create functional diversity that benefits the population as a whole.

Building upon this concept, the novel theory of noise-averaging cooperation (NAC) [@lopez2022] explains how stochastic metabolic noise can drive the emergence of cross-feeding interactions and metabolic interdependencies. Due to their small size, bacteria experience substantial noise in metabolic regulation, which limits individual growth rates. To compensate, related bacteria can share metabolites to 'average out' this noise and improve collective growth. This metabolite sharing, or 'leakage', can then facilitate the evolution of metabolic interdependencies and even drive speciation through gene deletions, as predicted by the Black Queen Hypothesis [@morris2012]. 

NAC thus provides a mechanistic link between stochastic gene expression noise and the emergence of genetic specialization within populations, bridging the gap between phenotypic and genetic mechanisms of variation. This theory explains how the initial noise-driven metabolite sharing can eventually lead to the evolution of stable auxotrophic dependencies, illustrating how phenotypic variation can become genetically encoded over time.


### Environmental Regulation

Environmental regulation further complicates this picture, as differential gene expression driven by microenvironmental cues and cellular perception of local conditions [@korshoj2024] can create spatial or temporal patterns of functional specialization within populations. These environmentally-induced variations can become stabilized through genetic changes if they confer consistent fitness benefits, illustrating how phenotypic plasticity can drive evolutionary innovation.

While intraspecific division of labor has been well-documented in multicellular organisms and social insects, its study in bacterial populations represents a more recent and growing field of research.





A major unsolved question is whether populations of genetically identical bacteria can minimise energetically costly processes by each executing different metabolic tasks at the intra-population level. Here, we hypothesise that metabolic cooperation between bacterial intra-populations plays a key role in modulating population dynamics, competitiveness and persistence at the root soil-interface. This hypothesis also builds on the idea that within a population, bacteria are inclined to "noisy regulation" of metabolism [@lopez2022], i.e. they do not all adjust their genome expression to the environmental constraints in the same way. In a stable environment, this would be expected to limit bacterial growth. However, because bacteria excrete compounds ("leaky function" forming a "metabolic marketplace"), the selection pressures at the population level would favour intra-population cross-feeding(s) fitting to the constraints, either supported by variations in gene expression or/and selection for useful variants that arise from non-synonymous mutations @fig-intraspecific-dol. Thus, by "Noise-Averaging Cooperation" (NAC) [@lopez2022] an intra-population-level division of labour is expected.

## Biological Hypothesis

Given that iron functions as a public good whose availability becomes rate-limiting in the root compartment and that production of the above-mentioned processes are all modulated by iron availability,[@lim2012] we propose that division of labour (DoL) among genetically identical *PsR401* cells may be reinforced under iron-limiting conditions, such as those found in the root habitat. In such scenarios, phenotypic heterogeneity—whether driven by gene expression noise or environmentally induced regulation—could lead to subpopulations specialising in complementary tasks, such as toxin production, antimicrobial defense, or siderophore-mediated iron acquisition, thereby enhancing population-level fitness.(see @fig-hypothesis-iron)

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in complex biological systems. While this technology has been widely applied to eukaryotic cells, its adaptation to bacterial systems has been challenging due to the unique characteristics of bacterial transcripts.

New technologies allow us to access within-species diversity and study the possible metabolic specialization between cells. Single-cell -omics have been developed for this purpose in human/plant health/development[@vandereyken2023; @nobori2025; @nobori] has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in complex biological systems. While this technology has been widely applied to eukaryotic cells, its adaptation to bacterial systems has been challenging due to the unique characteristics of bacterial transcripts.

Bacterial populations exhibit remarkable heterogeneity in gene expression, even within isogenic populations grown under controlled laboratory conditions. This heterogeneity plays crucial roles in various bacterial behaviors, including stress responses (1), antibiotic resistance (2,3), and virulence (4). Such heterogeneity enables bacterial populations to adapt to fluctuating environments through bet-hedging strategies (5) and allows for the establishment of division of labor within communities. Bet-hedging refers to a survival strategy where bacteria maintain a diverse population to ensure that some members can survive unpredictable environmental changes. Traditionally, studies of bacterial gene expression have relied on bulk RNA sequencing methods, which provide an average view of the transcriptome across a population. However, these approaches mask the underlying cell-to-cell variability that is critical for understanding complex bacterial behaviors and adaptations. The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has provided unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity across various biological systems. While scRNA-seq has been widely adopted for eukaryotic cells since its introduction in 2009 (6), its application to bacterial systems has lagged due to several technical challenges unique to prokaryotic cells. These challenges include the absence of poly-A tails on bacterial mRNAs, low RNA content in individual cells, and diverse cell wall structures. These factors necessitate the development of specialized techniques for efficient cell lysis, RNA extraction, and mRNA enrichment in bacterial systems. Despite these challenges, recent years have seen significant progress in developing and refining bacterial scRNA-seq methods (7e9). These advancements have opened new avenues for investigating bacterial physiology, stress responses, and population dynamics at unprecedented resolution.

## Our Focus: microSPLiT

Split-pool barcoding scRNA-seq Split-pool barcoding methods such as PETRI-seq (16) and microSPLiT (24) enable the simultaneous processing of large numbers of cells through multiple rounds of barcoding (Fig. 1A). Initially, a small number of permeabilized cells are distributed into multi-well plates, where each well contains unique reverse transcription primers. Within these wells, reverse transcription occurs inside the cells,generating cDNA from RNA while incorporating the first set of barcodes. The cells are then pooled together (Pool-step) and redistributed into other multi-well plates, where each well contains a distinct set of molecular barcodes. In this second barcoding step (Split-step), barcodes are ligated directly onto the cDNA molecules. This Split-and-Pool process is repeated multiple times, ensuring that each bacterial cell receives a unique barcode combination, thereby enabling high-throughput barcoded singlecell sequencing. Finally, the cells are lysed, and sequencing libraries are constructed for downstream analysis. These methods can process on the order of 104 cells, with a starting load of 105 to 107 cells, offering high throughput at the cost of some sensitivity. For instance, microSPLiT (24) detected an average of 138 genes per Escherichia coli cell from 40,000 sequencing reads. The main advantage of this approach is the ability to analyze large bacterial populations, which is particularly useful for studying rare cell states.

## Studying Bacterial Heterogeneity: The Challenge of Single-Cell Analysis

### The Need for Single-Cell Resolution

Bacterial populations exhibit remarkable heterogeneity in gene expression, even within isogenic populations grown under controlled laboratory conditions. This heterogeneity plays crucial roles in various bacterial behaviors, including stress responses, antibiotic resistance, and virulence. Such heterogeneity enables bacterial populations to adapt to fluctuating environments through bet-hedging strategies and allows for the establishment of division of labor within communities. Bet-hedging refers to a survival strategy where bacteria maintain a diverse population to ensure that some members can survive unpredictable environmental changes.

Traditionally, studies of bacterial gene expression have relied on bulk RNA sequencing methods, which provide an average view of the transcriptome across a population. However, these approaches mask the underlying cell-to-cell variability that is critical for understanding complex bacterial behaviors and adaptations.

Despite these challenges, recent years have seen significant progress in developing and refining bacterial scRNA-seq methods. These advancements have opened new avenues for investigating bacterial physiology, stress responses, and population dynamics at unprecedented resolution.

### The microSPLiT Approach

Split-pool barcoding methods such as PETRI-seq and microSPLiT enable the simultaneous processing of large numbers of cells through multiple rounds of barcoding. The microSPLiT workflow involves:

1. **Initial distribution**: Permeabilized cells are distributed into multi-well plates containing unique reverse transcription primers
2. **First barcoding**: Reverse transcription occurs inside cells, generating cDNA while incorporating the first set of barcodes
3. **Pooling and redistribution**: Cells are pooled and redistributed into new plates with distinct molecular barcodes

5. **Repetition**: This split-and-pool process is repeated multiple times
6. **Sequencing**: Each bacterial cell receives a unique barcode combination, enabling high-throughput single-cell sequencing

These methods can process on the order of 10^4 cells, with a starting load of 10^5 to 10^7 cells, offering high throughput at the cost of some sensitivity. For instance, microSPLiT detected an average of 138 genes per *Escherichia coli* cell from 40,000 sequencing reads. The main advantage of this approach is the ability to analyze large bacterial populations, which is particularly useful for studying rare cell states.

## Research Objectives and Approach

The goal of this internship is to explore scRNA-seq datasets of *Pseudomonas brassicacearum* to determine if division of labor can be detected within this species as a strategy for efficient root colonization. The intern will:

1. **Analyze transcriptomic data** from ultra-high throughput sequencing runs under various nutritional conditions
2. **Implement bioinformatic workflows** using existing tools to process bacterial scRNA-seq data
3. **Develop custom pipelines** to address the specific challenges of bacterial transcriptomics
4. **Identify patterns of metabolic specialization** that may indicate division of labor within isogenic populations
5. **Produce interpretable results** that contribute to our understanding of bacterial population dynamics

This research will leverage the power of single-cell transcriptomics to test our hypothesis that iron limitation promotes division of labor among genetically identical *PsR401* cells, ultimately enhancing their collective fitness and root colonization efficiency.
















Our Focus: microSPLiT

One of the most promising approaches for bacterial scRNA-seq is microSPLiT, a split-pool barcoding method that enables high-throughput transcriptome profiling of individual bacterial cells.

This method relies on iterative rounds of cell pooling and barcoding:
	1.	First round: Permeabilized cells are distributed into wells containing barcoded reverse transcription primers. cDNA synthesis occurs in situ, embedding the first barcode.
	2.	Second round: Cells are pooled and redistributed into new wells for ligation of a second barcode.
	3.	Further rounds (optional): Additional barcoding steps ensure a unique barcode combination for each cell.

After barcoding, cells are lysed and sequencing libraries are prepared. The approach supports the simultaneous processing of tens of thousands of bacterial cells (e.g., ~40,000 reads per E. coli cell detecting ~138 genes [@nishimura2025]), enabling robust profiling of population-level diversity.

While microSPLiT sacrifices some sensitivity compared to full-length sequencing, its scalability and compatibility with bacterial physiology make it an ideal tool to investigate rare subpopulations and test our DoL hypothesis under various nutrient regimes.
