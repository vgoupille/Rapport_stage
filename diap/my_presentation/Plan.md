‚ÄúHowever, a major unsolved question is whether populations of genetically identical bacteria can minimise energetically costly processes by each executing different metabolic tasks at the intra-population level. Here, we hypothesise that metabolic cooperation between bacterial intra-populations plays a key role in modulating population dynamics, competitiveness and persistence at the root soil-interface. This hypothesis also builds on the idea that within a population, bacteria are inclined to 'noisy regulation' of metabolism (Lopez & Wingreen, 2022), i.e. they do not all adjust their genome expression to the environmental constraints in the same way. In a stable environment, this would be expected to limit bacterial growth. However, because bacteria excrete compounds (‚Äòleaky function‚Äô forming a ‚Äòmetabolic marketplace‚Äô), the selection pressures at the population level would favour intra-population cross-feeding(s) fitting to the constraints, either supported by variations in gene expression or/and selection for useful variants that arise from non-synonymous mutations (Figure 1). Thus, by ‚Äònoise-averaging cooperation‚Äô (Lopez & Wingreen, 2022) an intra-population-level division of labour is expected.‚Äù

However, a major unsolved question is whether populations of genetically identical bacteria can minimise energetically costly processes by each executing different metabolic tasks at the intra-population level.

- ‚ÄúA similar analysis of binary interactions among 198 A. thaliana root-isolated bacteria identified Pseudomonas brassicacearum as a potent antagonist that relies on the combined action of two exometabolites, an antimicrobial and an iron chelator, that suppress competitors, and thereby promote its root colonization (Getzke et al, 2023).‚Äù (Mesny et al., 2023, p. 9)
- ‚ÄúResource competition represents an important mechanism for indirect microbial antagonism (Hassani et al, 2018). The ability to rapidly utilize a limited resource can be detrimental for a less competitive microbe. Additionally, microbes can sequester resources, preventing utilization by other community members. Siderophores chelate soil iron for microbial uptake and are differentially exploitable to prevent other microbes to obtain essential iron resources (Joshi et al, 2006).‚Äù (Mesny et al., 2023, p. 9)
- ‚ÄúFor instance, pyoverdine is an iron-chelator produced by some A. thaliana root-associated bacteria contributing to their competitiveness (Getzke et al, 2023).‚Äù (Mesny et al., 2023, p. 9)

-  Unlike many pathogenic bacteria, R401 lacks genes for a type III secretion system and does not overgrow or suppress plant immune responses.
- 
‚Ä¢ Research by St√©phane Hacquard (Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Cologne) found that ~95% of plant-associated bacteria are neutral or beneficial in one-on-one interactions with _Arabidopsis thaliana_.

‚Ä¢ _Pseudomonas brassicacearum_ R401 is a dominant plant microbiota member but can be detrimental under laboratory conditions.

‚Ä¢ However, in natural soil conditions, R401 does not cause disease, suggesting it requires specific environmental conditions to become pathogenic.

‚Ä¢ This mutation turned R401 into a plant-beneficial bacterium.

‚Ä¢ **Effects of brassicapeptin**

‚Ä¢ Alone, brassicapeptin can induce plant disease under high salt conditions.

‚Ä¢ It is toxic to _Arabidopsis_, tomato plants under salt stress, and other microbes.

‚Ä¢ The molecule has a fatty acid tail linked to amino acids and can form pores in plant membranes, likely increasing salt stress sensitivity.



Successful establishment of bacteria at roots is driven by multiple independent biological processes involved in both host-microbe (i.e., signal recognition, chemotaxis, surface attachment, biofilm formation, virulence factors) and microbe-microbe interactions (i.e., production of antimicrobials or public goods) (Knights et al. 2021). Therefore, we postulate that the simultaneous activation of these diverse processes is costly and that cooperation between genetically identical strains is key for promoting bacterial pervasiveness at roots. Consistent with this hypothesis, we recently demonstrated that the robust root coloniser Pseudomonas brassicacearum R401 (hereafter referred to as PsR401) deploys multiple independent strategies that co-function to promote colonisation and persistence at roots (Getzke et al., 2023). Notably, we identified two independent processes involved in microbe-microbe competition ‚Äì namely the production of an antimicrobial and of a molecule scavenging the micronutrient iron ‚Äì that act additively to promote strain competitiveness at roots (Getzke et al., 2023). We identified a third bacterial locus in PsR401 involved in the production of a phytotoxin that promotes both pathogenicity and root colonisation in mono-association experiments with A. thaliana (unpublished, see below). Our work provides proof-of-concept data illustrating that PsR401 deploys diverse exo-metabolites during root microbiota establishment that have versatile functions in host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions. Together with earlier work (Gu et al. 2020, Harbort et al 2020), it also delineates iron as a major micronutrient modulating strain competitiveness and proliferation at roots. Given that the public good iron becomes rate-limiting in the root compartment and that production of the above-mentioned processes are all modulated by iron availability (Lim et al., 2012; Palma et al., 2003, Mo et al. 1991), we anticipate that division of labour between bacterial intra-populations is bolstered under iron limiting conditions such as those found in the root habitat.

Le fer est un **‚Äúbien public‚Äù** : toutes les bact√©ries en ont besoin, mais il est rare dans l‚Äôenvironnement racinaire. Or :

Dans ce contexte, **une division du travail au sein de la population de PsR401** serait **avantageuse** :

- D‚Äôautres dans la **capture du fer**.
    
- D‚Äôautres encore dans la **production de phytotoxines**.
    

  

‚û°Ô∏è Cela permettrait √† la **population globale d‚Äôassurer toutes les fonctions n√©cessaires** √† une colonisation efficace, **tout en minimisant le co√ªt pour chaque cellule individuellement**.



# Scientific Questions

H2 (WP2): In a population of Pseudomonas brassicacearum (PsR401), individuals activate different biological and metabolic processes, promoting intra-population functional diversity and allowing a rapid division of labour to colonise the environment (with a particular focus on the root-environment)

- Is there functional specialization (DoL) within clonal populations of PSR401?
    
- Can scRNA-seq reveal transcriptional heterogeneity?
    
- Are certain cells specialized under stress (e.g. iron or glucose limitation)?
    
- Is this driven by noisy gene expression or regulated mechanisms?

The major goal of the project is to obtain mechanistic insights into whether and how a robust bacterial root coloniser can partition tasks within intra-populations to achieve greater functional diversity, minimise the energetic cost of processes, and adapt to environmental constraints to promote population density at roots. Given that at a micro-scale, niche partitioning is often observed between bacterial populations at roots, we hypothesise that cooperation within a bacterial population is at least as important as cooperation between bacterial populations for promoting overall population density. We anticipate that a single cell can only achieve a limited number of functions and that greater functional diversity can be achieved through within-population cooperation, especially under nutritional constraints. Given that iron is rate-limiting in roots, we particularly aim at testing the relevance of division of labour between bacterial intra-populations in the context of iron availability.

Technical Challenges in Bacterial scRNA-seq

[@nishimuraRecentAdvancesSinglecell2025]

Bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) faces several unique challenges due to the distinct characteristics of prokaryotic cells. These challenges include the lack of poly-A tails in bacterial mRNAs, high rRNA content, low RNA levels, and complex cell wall structures. Solutions have been developed for each issue:

1. **Lack of Poly-A Tails**: Unlike eukaryotic mRNAs, bacterial transcripts lack poly-A tails, requiring alternative methods for mRNA capture, such as random hexamer priming or custom-designed capture probes.
    
2. **High rRNA Content**: With rRNA constituting up to 95% of bacterial RNA, effective depletion methods, such as RNase H- and Cas9-based rRNA depletion, are essential for isolating mRNA.
    
3. **Low RNA Content**: Bacterial cells contain much less RNA than mammalian cells, necessitating highly sensitive capture and amplification techniques. Reverse transcriptases like SuperScript IV and the use of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) help address this issue.
    
4. **Diverse Cell Wall Structures**: Bacterial cell walls can complicate RNA extraction, with different species requiring tailored lysis protocols to avoid RNA degradation.
    
5. **Operon Integrity**: To capture bacterial operons fully, long-read sequencing methods, such as RamDA-seq, are required.
    
6. **Non-Coding RNA Detection**: Detecting small RNAs (sRNAs) is challenging due to their short length and low reverse transcription efficiency. High-sensitivity methods are necessary to capture these regulatory molecules.
    

Despite these hurdles, bacterial scRNA-seq techniques have advanced rapidly, improving sensitivity, throughput, and versatility across bacterial species.

### Technical Approaches in bacterial scRNA-seq

Here‚Äôs a bullet point summary of the **Methodological Approaches in Bacterial scRNA-seq**:

**1. Plate-based scRNA-seq:**

‚Ä¢ Methods: MATQseq, improved MATQseq, and RamDA-seq with Cas9-based rRNA depletion.

‚Ä¢ Process: Individual bacterial cells isolated into wells using FACS, followed by RNA extraction and reverse transcription.

‚Ä¢ Strengths:

‚Ä¢ High RNA recovery rates and sensitivity.

‚Ä¢ Can detect non-coding RNAs, including sRNAs.

‚Ä¢ Limitations:

‚Ä¢ Low throughput (hundreds of cells per experiment).

‚Ä¢ High sensitivity but limited by the number of cells processed.

‚Ä¢ Example: Improved MATQ-seq detected 375 genes per cell with 8‚Äì14 million reads.

  

**2. Split-pool barcoding scRNA-seq:**

‚Ä¢ Methods: PETRI-seq, microSPLiT.

‚Ä¢ Process: Multiple rounds of barcoding, where cells are distributed into wells with unique primers, then pooled and redistributed for additional barcoding steps.

‚Ä¢ Strengths:

‚Ä¢ High throughput, able to process 10‚Å¥ cells from a starting load of 10‚Åµ‚Äì10‚Å∑ cells.

‚Ä¢ Efficient for analyzing large bacterial populations and rare cell states.

‚Ä¢ Limitations:

‚Ä¢ Lower sensitivity than plate-based methods.

‚Ä¢ Example: microSPLiT detected 138 genes per _E. coli_ cell with 40,000 reads.

  

**3. Droplet-based scRNA-seq:**

‚Ä¢ Methods: BacDrop, ProBac-seq, M3-seq, smRandom-seq.

‚Ä¢ Process: Bacterial cells are encapsulated in droplets with barcoded beads/primers, followed by cDNA synthesis and cell barcode labeling.

‚Ä¢ Strengths:

‚Ä¢ High throughput, processing thousands to hundreds of thousands of cells.

‚Ä¢ Relatively high sensitivity compared to split-pool methods.

‚Ä¢ Limitations:

‚Ä¢ Trade-off between throughput and sensitivity, though still very effective.

‚Ä¢ Example:

‚Ä¢ BacDrop: 90 mRNA genes per _E. coli_ cell with 80,000 reads.

‚Ä¢ M3-seq: 350 genes per _E. coli_ cell with 30,000 reads.

‚Ä¢ smRandom-seq: 1045 genes per _E. coli_ cell with 50,000 reads (highest sensitivity).

## Bioinformatics Analysis ‚Äî My Role

### Waiting for sequencing results‚Ä¶ but pipeline already explored


- after sequencing ==> Bioinformatic analyse : The Aim of my internship : 
	- I will not develop this part because i wait the result for the moment 

	- Different step :
----
### 1. Preprocessing

- Read quality control
    
- Demultiplexing and barcode processing
    
- **STARsolo**¬†for alignment and quantification (UMIs per gene per cell)
    
    - Best tool based on benchmarking (Zhang et al., 2023)
        
    - Handles multi-mapping, unique reads
        
- Output: count matrix (genes √ó cells)
    

	- ## 1-Preprocessing

- Alignment and UMI quantification per gene

- I found a benchmarking study comparing different tools

-**STARsolo** is the best tool for bacterial scRNA-seq data

- I test it on Solene's dataset

- => output : matrix of UMI counts per gene per cell

- (different parameters that could be consider)
		- pre-control : quality control of reads
		- demultiplexage and Genome Aligment of read to Generate Matrix of count => StarSolo 
			- Unique or Multiples aligment 
		- filtering mRNA or not 


### 2. Quality Control

- Remove rRNA/tRNA (if needed)
    
- Remove low-quality cells:
    
    - Few genes / few UMIs
        
    - Manual thresholding
        
    - Scanpy / Seurat for filtering
        
- Ambient RNA / doublets (if droplet-based): tools like SoupX, CellBender, DecontX
    
- Evaluate filtering thresholds carefully
		- quality control of cell (Seurat or Scanpy)
			- filtering (manual step)
			- number of count  
			- number of genes ...
		- mayby consibient ambient RNA (and doublet)(SoupX , DecontX, Cellbender scAR for droplet methods , 10X...)
		
	plusieurs all√© retour pour comparer les filtres , peut etre cellules faiblement exprime sont bien de potentiel cellules mais etat latent

### 3. Downstream Analysis

- Normalization:¬†**SCTransform**¬†or log-normalization
    
- Scaling, dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP)
    
- Batch correction / Integration
    
    - Compare different methods (CCA, Harmony, RPCA‚Ä¶)
        
- Clustering (Louvain, Leiden)
    
- Differential expression (DE) between clusters/conditions
    
- Pseudotime inference? (if trajectory present)
    
- Metabolic inference (e.g., pathway activation)

then dowanstream analyse : 

- normalization, scalling , reduction of dimension, to consider only most variable gene for the analysis 
-   intergration (to consider batch effect)  and clustering strategies
compare differentes methods of integration  (various methodes, machine learning )

-DE betwenn cluster  to many see 
- pseudo-bulk 
- potentialy analysus of pseudotime analysis, trajectory 
- compare

- ### Alternative: BacSC pipeline

- Data-driven pipeline for bacterial scRNA-seq
    
- Fully automated:
    
    - Adaptive filtering
        
    - Variance stabilization
        
    - Optimized clustering / DE
        
- Still a preprint, developed for BACseq (not SPLiT)
    
- Could help avoid subjective bias
- 
-  Evaluate **BacSC**, a pipeline for bacterial scRNA-seq
	- avoid some error but it was originaly develo on BACseq, alway a prepint 
    

---

## Conclusions & Next Steps

- Awaiting sequencing results to begin full analysis
    
- Explored preprocessing pipelines (STARsolo)
    
- Tested different quality control and normalization strategies
    
- Investigated Seurat vs Scanpy workflows
