- Conclusion and Perspectives

### 4. References
- Format: NATURE style
- 10-20 references for engineering internship
- 15-30 references for research internship
- Superscript numbering in text
- All cited articles must have been read

### 5. Back Cover

- 4-5 keywords in both languages

## Important Points

### Writing Quality
- Writing quality is evaluated
- Proofreading is strongly recommended
- Grammar and spelling mistakes can affect the grade
- Grade cannot exceed 10/20 if there are too many mistakes

### Technical Requirements
- All pages must be numbered
- Figures and tables can be integrated in text or at the end
- Total length must not exceed 25 pages
- References must be placed after conclusion
- Use of bibliographic management software is mandatory
- Code snippets should be properly formatted and commented
- Data visualizations should be clear and publication-ready

### Bioinformatics-Specific Guidelines
- Document all software versions used
- Include command-line scripts in appendices
- Provide links to public repositories if applicable
- Explain all bioinformatics tools and their parameters
- Include validation methods for your analyses
- Document data preprocessing steps
- Provide clear descriptions of algorithms used

### Appendices
- Optional (max 5 pages)
- Must start on new page
- Must have title
- Referenced as (see appendix x)
- Not counted in pagination
- Can include:
  - Detailed methodology
  - Code snippets
  - Additional figures
  - Data processing pipelines
  - Statistical analyses details

## Tips for Success

1. Start writing early
2. Keep track of references as you go
3. Make regular backups of your code and data
4. Follow the format guidelines strictly
5. Have your work proofread
6. Plan your time carefully
7. Keep in regular contact with your supervisors
8. Save all your data and code
9. Document your methods thoroughly
10. Make sure all figures are clear and properly labeled
11. Use version control (Git) for your code
12. Document your computational environment
13. Include reproducibility instructions
14. Validate your bioinformatics results
15. Keep a detailed lab notebook of your analyses
