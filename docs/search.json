    "text": "3.1 Preprocessing of the sequencing data\nThis chapter presents the findings of our single-cell RNA-seq analysis of P. brassicacearum R401, focusing on the division of labor within bacterial populations. To investigate division of labor patterns, we first established robust data quality through comprehensive preprocessing and quality control steps. We then applied appropriate filtering strategies to ensure reliable cell identification and gene expression quantification. These preliminary steps are essential prerequisites that will enable us to characterize the cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional diversity across different experimental conditions to identify potential division of labor mechanisms.",

This possibly includes both unique and multi-mapped reads that match exactly to their reference locations\nThe number of detected cell barcodes (nCellBarcodes = 699,355) is high, suggesting good cellular diversity\nThe number of UMIs (nUMIs = 34,258,961) indicates good molecular coverage\n\nThese metrics suggest that our data is of good technical quality, although the low saturation indicates potential for deeper sequencing.",

To succeed, organisms must compete, cooperate, and/or specialize based on how well their traits enable resource acquisition and utilization in their biotic and abiotic environment. Division of Labor (DoL) represents one such strategy - the specialization of tasks of entities, optimizing resource use and enhancing collective performance1. This fundamental principle operates throughout biological systems, from molecular evolution where gene duplication enables enzyme specialization, to multicellular organisms where cellular differentiation creates specialized tissues, to eusocial insect societies with their reproductive and functional caste systems2. Division of labour occurs when different individuals, cells or tissues become specialised to perform complementary tasks that benefit the whole organism or social group3.",

Giri and colleagues have attempted to define the concept of DoL specifically within microbial communities, identifying key criteria that distinguish true DoL from other types of ecological interactions2. Microbial interactions can be classified based on their directionality and the species involved (Figure 1.1). Interactions can be unidirectional or bidirectional, and can occur within the same species (intraspecific) or between different species (interspecific). For an interaction to qualify as true DoL, it must involve reciprocal fitness benefits between partners, where both participants gain from the interaction. The figure below illustrates this distinction, showing how closed (reciprocal) interactions provide mutual fitness benefits, while open (linear) interactions represent parasitic or unidirectional relationships that do not qualify as DoL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Division of Labor in Microbial Communities (from Giri et al. 2019)\n\n\n\nClassification of pairwise and three-way interactions as DoL. Interactions can be uni- or bidirectional as well as occur within one or between two microbial species. Arrows indicate fitness benefits that are exchanged between interaction partners that can be direct (straight line) or indirect (dashed line). For an interaction to classify as DoL, four main criteria need to be fulfilled, which is only the case in closed (reciprocal) interactions (green), yet not in open (linear) interactions (red). (a) Mutually beneficial (reciprocal) interaction within two conspecific genotypes. (b) Mutually beneficial (reciprocal) interaction within two heterospecific genotypes.

    "text": "1.3 Division of Labor in Root Microbiota\nInterspecific DoL has been well-characterized in various ecosystems, with numerous examples of cross-feeding and mutualistic interactions documented in the human gut microbiome and soil communities4.\nThe root microbiota represents a particularly well-studied example of interspecific DoL. Roots of healthy plants host diverse bacteria that are collectively referred to as the bacterial root microbiota. Unlike their multicellular eukaryotic hosts that evolved diverse cell-types to achieve distinct biological functions and promote a division of labour, unicellular organisms such as bacteria rely on metabolic exchange(s) with their surrounding biotic environment to establish and maintain their ecological niches. Recent reports5,6, indicate that metabolic interdependencies and cross-feeding exchanges are widespread among taxonomically diverse bacteria and likely drive microbial co-existence within complex bacterial communities7,8.\nWhile interspecific DoL has been extensively studied, intraspecific DoL within clonal/isogenic bacterial populations remains less explored, despite its potential importance for understanding population-level adaptation and functional diversity. The traditional view of biological populations assumed that all individuals within a clonal population behave identically. However, evidence has accumulated over decades showing that even genetically identical organisms can exhibit functional heterogeneity, leading to population-level benefits through task specialization2 9.\nA major unsolved question is whether populations of genetically identical bacteria can minimise energetically costly processes by each executing different metabolic tasks at the intra-population level. Here, we hypothesise that metabolic cooperation within bacterial populations plays a key role in modulating population dynamics, competitiveness, and persistence at the root–soil interface. This hypothesis builds on the idea that bacteria are subject to stochastic, noisy gene expression10–12. In such systems, not all individuals respond identically to environmental cues, leading to phenotypic heterogeneity. This noise-driven diversity can be beneficial at the population level. The theory of Noise-Averaging Cooperation (NAC)13 further proposes that metabolic noise—exacerbated by the small size of bacteria—can constrain individual growth, but can be mitigated through metabolite sharing among related cells. This “leaky function”, forming a “metabolic marketplace”, allows populations to buffer stochastic fluctuations and improve collective fitness. In this context, cross-feeding interactions may emerge as a result of gene expression variability and/or the selection of advantageous mutations, fostering metabolic interdependencies within the population (see Figure 1.2).\nFinally, environmental regulation also shapes this process: microenvironmental cues and spatial heterogeneity can induce context-dependent gene expression patterns9,14, which, if consistently beneficial, may become genetically encoded over evolutionary time. Altogether, these mechanisms point toward an intra-population division of labour emerging from the interplay between gene expression noise, environmental signals, and evolutionary selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Examples of benefits and sources of intraspecific division of labour between intra-populations based on metabolic complementation and costly “common good” metabolite production.\n\n\n\nFrom the left to the right, co-metabolism within an isogenic bacterial population (A) and production of antimicrobials targeting other bacteria (B) can be considered as division of labour in a population. These mechanisms of division of labour can be based on differential transcription between bacteria (C) within a population and/or genetic variations between intra-populations (D).",

    "text": "1.4 PsR401: A Model System for Studying Intraspecific DoL\nTo investigate these theoretical frameworks of intraspecific DoL, we require a well-characterized bacterial model system that exhibits the complex metabolic interactions described above. Successful establishment of bacteria at roots is driven by multiple independent biological processes involved in both host-microbe (i.e., signal recognition, chemotaxis, surface attachment, biofilm formation, virulence factors)9 and microbe-microbe interactions (i.e., production of antimicrobials or public goods)15. Therefore, we postulate that the simultaneous activation of these diverse processes is costly and that cooperation between genetically identical strains is key for promoting bacterial pervasiveness at roots. Consistent with this hypothesis, it was recently demonstrated that the robust root coloniser Pseudomonas brassicacearum R401 (hereafter referred to as PsR401) deploys multiple independent strategies that co-function to promote colonisation and persistence at roots16. Unlike many pathogenic bacteria, PsR401 lacks genes for a type III secretion system (T3SS) and does not overgrow or suppress plant immune responses17,18. This opportunistic pathogen19 of the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana acts as a potent antagonist that relies on the combined action of three distinct exometabolites to suppress competitors and promote root colonization.\nFirst, this Gram-negative bacterium produces a phytotoxin called Brassicapeptin19,20, which promotes both pathogenicity and root colonization in mono-association experiments with Arabidopsis thaliana. Second, PsR401 synthesizes 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG)16, an antimicrobial compound that directly inhibits competing microbes. Third, it produces pyoverdine16, a siderophore that chelates iron from the environment—an essential but scarce micronutrient in the rhizosphere21.\nIron availability plays a central role in microbial interactions at the root–soil interface. It also delineates iron as a major micronutrient modulating strain competitiveness and proliferation at roots22,23. In iron-limited environments, siderophore-mediated iron scavenging confers a strong competitive advantage by depriving rival microbes of access to this vital resource. Resource competition, especially for iron, thus represents a key mechanism of indirect microbial antagonism. Beyond simply acquiring nutrients, microbes may also sequester them, preventing uptake by others and modulating community composition and function24.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiological Hypothesis\n\n\n\nGiven that iron functions as a public good whose availability becomes rate-limiting in the root compartment and that production of the above-mentioned processes are all modulated by iron availability,25 we propose that division of labour (DoL) among genetically identical PsR401 cells may be reinforced under iron-limiting conditions, such as those found in the root habitat. In such scenarios, phenotypic heterogeneity—whether driven by gene expression noise or environmentally induced regulation—could lead to subpopulations specialising in complementary tasks, such as toxin production, antimicrobial defense, or siderophore-mediated iron acquisition, thereby enhancing population-level fitness.",

Traditionally, studies of bacterial gene expression have relied on bulk RNA sequencing methods, which provide an average view of the transcriptome across a population.26 However, these approaches mask the underlying cell-to-cell variability that is critical for understanding complex bacterial behaviors and adaptations. The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and now multi-omics technologies has provided unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity across various biological systems27–29. Although eukaryotic cells have benefited from scRNA-seq technology since 2009, prokaryotic systems have faced significant implementation delays owing to distinct technical obstacles. These challenges include low RNA content in individual cells, the absence of poly-A tails on bacterial mRNAs, and diverse cell wall structures.26 These factors necessitate the development of specialized techniques for efficient cell lysis, RNA extraction, and mRNA enrichment in bacterial systems. Despite these challenges, recent years have seen significant progress in developing and refining bacterial scRNA-seq methods26,30. These methodological improvements have created novel opportunities to explore bacterial physiology, stress responses, and population dynamics at single-cell resolution.",

This cutting-edge bacterial scRNA-seq method enables high-throughput profiling of individual bacterial cells, providing the resolution necessary to detect transcriptional heterogeneity within clonal populations. By analyzing PsR401 cells under contrasting nutrient conditions—particularly iron-limited versus iron-replete environments—we hope to identify potential subpopulations that specialize in different metabolic tasks (see Figure 1.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Hypothesis of DoL in PsR401 under iron-limiting conditions\n\n\n\nTesting the division of labor hypothesis in PsR401 under two contrasting conditions: iron-limited and iron-replete environments. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with microSPLiT will enable detection of transcriptional heterogeneity within the population, revealing whether this specialization is driven by gene expression noise or environmentally induced metabolic specialization in both environmental conditions.\n\n\nInternship Goals and Expected Outcomes\nBuilding upon the theoretical framework of intraspecific division of labor and the biological characteristics of PsR401, this internship aims to leverage cutting-edge single-cell transcriptomics to investigate metabolic cooperation within clonal bacterial populations. The primary goal is to validate the microSPLiT technology for bacterial systems while testing our hypothesis that iron limitation promotes functional specialization among genetically identical cells.\nThrough systematic analysis of transcriptional heterogeneity under contrasting iron conditions in culture medium, we expect to uncover whether PsR401 populations exhibit distinct subpopulations with specialized metabolic functions or whether cooperation emerges through noisy gene expression regulation across the population. By examining temporal dynamics of gene expression patterns, we will gain insights into how these cooperative behaviors evolve and stabilize over time. This investigation will provide critical insights into the mechanisms underlying population-level adaptation and resilience, particularly in the context of fluctuating iron availability.\nThe expected outcomes of this research extend beyond understanding PsR401 biology. By establishing robust methodologies for bacterial single-cell transcriptomics, this work will contribute to the broader field of microbial population dynamics.\nUltimately, this project will advance our understanding of how phenotypic diversity among clonal bacterial populations facilitates ecological success and resilience during root colonization, while establishing methodological foundations for future studies of bacterial population dynamics at single-cell resolution.\n\n\n\n\n1.

This design resulted in 18 total experimental conditions (2 media × 3 biological replicates × 3 timepoints) for subsequent single-cell RNA-seq analysis.\nAn isogenic1 population of P. brassicacearum R401 was initially cultured on petri dishes and then transferred to different liquid media to investigate the effects of nutrient availability on bacterial growth and gene expression (Figure 2.1).\nTwo distinct culture conditions were applied to the bacteria: M9 medium containing low glucose and low iron concentrations, and M9F medium containing high glucose and high iron concentrations (see Table A.1 for detailed concentrations). Each condition was replicated three times to ensure statistical robustness of the experimental results. The bacterial growth was monitored by measuring optical density (OD) at regular intervals. The growth curves obtained from these measurements are presented (Figure 2.2) and (Table A.2). This experimental design resulted in a total of 18 conditions: 2 media types × 3 biological replicates × 3 time points, providing comprehensive coverage of the growth dynamics under different nutrient conditions.\nMeasurements were taken at three timepoints (T1, T2, T3) for three biological replicates (Rep A, B, C).\nThe growth curves reveal distinct patterns between the two culture conditions. Bacteria grown in M9F medium (high glucose and iron) exhibited significantly higher growth rates and reached higher optical densities (OD 0.17-0.21 at T1, 0.59-0.63 at T2, 0.74-0.83 at T3) compared to M9 medium (low glucose and iron) which showed limited growth (OD 0.13 at T1, 0.28-0.33 at T2, 0.26 at T3). While M9F cultures showed continued growth from T2 to T3, the growth rate slowed down during this period, indicating the beginning of transition towards stationary phase. The M9 cultures appeared to reach a growth plateau by T3, while M9F cultures maintained higher densities despite the growth deceleration, suggesting nutrient limitation in the M9 condition. Biological replicates showed excellent reproducibility validating the experimental design.\nCells were collected at each timepoint (T1, T2, T3) from all biological replicates for subsequent single-cell RNA-seq analysis using the Microbial split-pool ligation transcriptomics (microSPLiT) protocol1,2.",

    "section": "2.2 microSPLiT protocol",
    "text": "2.2 microSPLiT protocol\nMicroSPLiT1,2 is a high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing method for bacteria, capable of profiling transcriptional states in hundreds of thousands of cells per experiment without the need for specialized equipment1,3. Unlike other single-cell RNA-seq approaches that require physical isolation of individual cells (e.g., plate-based or droplet-based methods), microSPLiT uses a split-pool barcoding strategy to uniquely label transcripts within each cell. (see Figure A.1 for an overview of single-cell RNA-seq methods in bacteria)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation\n\n\n\nThe microSPLiT strategy will not be described in detail here; for more information, see Gaisser protocol.1. Only the key steps necessary for a general understanding of the method are presented below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: MicroSPLiT in-cell cDNA barcoding scheme.\n\n\n\na, Bacterial cells are fixed overnight and permeabilized before the mRNA is preferentially polyadenylated. After mRNA enrichment, cells may contain both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated mRNA. b, Cells are distributed into the first barcoding plate, and the mRNA is reverse transcribed by using a mixture of poly-dT and random hexamer primers carrying a barcode (barcode 1, BC1) and a 5’ phosphate for future ligation at their 5’ end. After the barcoding reaction, cells are pooled together and split again into the second barcoded plate. c, Ligation adds a 5’ phosphorylated barcode 2 (BC2) to BC1 with a linker strand. A blocking solution is then added to each of the wells of the second plate, preventing any unreacted BC2 from future ligation. Cells are pooled and split into the third and final barcoded plate. d, A second ligation step adds barcode 3 (BC3) with another linker strand. BC3 also contains a 5’ biotin, a primer binding site and a unique molecular identifier (UMI). A blocking solution for the R3 linker is added to each of the wells in the plate before the final pooling of cells. This results in uniquely barcoded cells that can be distributed in aliquots into sub-libraries and stored until future use or used immediately for library preparation. (R1, round 1; R2, round 2; R3, round 3).1\n\nFixation and permeabilization\nThe first step is fixation of the bacterial suspension with formaldehyde Figure 2.3 immediately after sampling the 18 conditions Figure 2.1. This preserves the transcriptomic state and cross-links RNA to proteins, preventing leakage of each cell’s transcriptome. Next, cells are permeabilized using mild detergent and lysozyme, allowing enzymes and oligonucleotides to access intracellular RNA for barcoding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAdequate permeabilization is essential for efficient barcoding, but over-permeabilization can compromise cell integrity. For successful single-cell resolution, cells must remain intact after permeabilization to allow multiple split-pool steps and retain cross-linked RNA. Figure 2.3\n\n\n\n\nmRNA enrichment\nAfter permeabilization, the transcripts in the fixed and permeabilized cells undergo in situ polyadenylation with the addition of a poly(A) polymerase (PAP) and ATP. This step enriches for mRNA in the total barcoded RNA pool because, under these conditions, PAP preferentially polyadenylates mRNA as opposed to ribosomique RNA (rRNA) Figure 2.3.\n\n\nBarcoding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe protocol utilizes several rounds of split-pool barcoding where cells are distributed into 96-well plates, barcoded, pooled, and redistributed for subsequent rounds, creating unique barcode combinations that identify individual cells.\n\n\n\nBarcoding round 1 (R1) to identify the condition and the technical replicate\nEach of the 18 samples is split into 5 technical replicates for barcoding, resulting in 90 subsamples. These technical replicates are then distributed into individual wells of a 96-well plate (6 wells not used), with each well containing uniquely barcoded primers Figure 2.3. In each well, mRNA is reverse transcribed into cDNA using a mix of barcoded poly(T) and random hexamer primers. The primers used in each well contain either a dT15 sequence to capture polyadenylated mRNA or six random nucleotides to bind any RNA, followed by a universal sequence for subsequent ligation steps. By assigning each technical replicate to a specific well, all cells in the same well receive the same unique barcode during reverse transcription. This allows each technical replicate and condition to be identified later based on the first barcode.\n\n\nBarcoding rounds 2 (R2) and 3 (R3) for unique cell and transcript identification\nCells are then pooled, washed and randomly redistributed into a new 96-well plate (round 2 (R2) ligation working plate) containing a second set of well-specific barcodes, which are appended to the first barcode on the cDNA through an in-cell ligation reaction Figure 2.3. Due to the random redistribution of cells, each well of the second-round plate is likely to contain a mix of cells with different first-round barcodes, resulting in highly diverse barcode combinations. The ligation reaction is carried out by the T4 DNA ligase, which requires double-stranded DNA. Therefore, in the second barcoding plate, each barcode is first hybridized to a short linker oligonucleotide whose overhang is complementary to the universal sequence at the 5’ end of the RT barcodes. Figure 2.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAfter the ligation step, some barcodes may remain unreacted in the solution. To prevent these free barcodes from attaching non-specifically to DNA from other cells during pooling, a blocker strand is added. This blocker has a longer complementary region to the linker, allowing it to displace any unreacted barcodes from the linker and thus ensures that only correctly ligated barcodes remain attached to the cDNA. Figure 2.3\n\n\nCells are then pooled again, and a split-ligation-pool cycle is repeated for the second time. Cells are randomly distributed into a third 96-well plate (round 3 (R3) ligation working plate), which is loaded with barcoded oligonucleotides containing the third cell barcode annealed with a linker, a 10-base Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI), a universal PCR handle and a 5’ biotin2 molecule. The ligation reaction is stopped by adding a second blocker strand and EDTA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIn our experiment, only 95 out of the 96 wells of the R3 plate are used to minimize potential bias in cell distribution. This setup allows for 90 × 96 × 95 = 820,800 possible barcode combinations, enabling the identification of up to 820,800 individual cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nSub-library and sequencing preparation\nThe pooled cells are washed, counted, and divided into multiple sub-libraries. Only sub-libraries containing approximately 3,000 cells were selected for sequencing, in order to maximize sequencing depth per cell and minimize barcode collision rates which is the probability that two cells receive the same barcode combination.\nAfter lysis and cDNA purification on streptavidin beads (Figure A.2), a second reverse transcription is performed to improve cDNA yield, during which a template switch oligo (TSO) is added to introduce a 3’ adapter. The resulting cDNA is then amplified by PCR. Following amplification, a size selection step removes short byproducts such as adapter or barcode dimers, ensuring that only high-quality cDNA fragments are retained for sequencing.\nTo optimize sequencing depth, the final library was split into four sub-libraries, each receiving a distinct index during adapter ligation: BC_0076 (CAGATC), BC_0077 (ACTTGA), BC_0078 (TAGCTT), and BC_0079 (GGCTAC). These indexes were used solely to improve sequencing quality and balance on the NovaSeq platform, without introducing any experimental or technical variation between sub-libraries.\n\n\nSequencing and demultiplexing sub-libraries\nSequencing was performed on a NovaSeqTM X plus instrument at GenoBIRD platform in paired-end mode. The library pool was loaded onto all lanes of the flowcell at a final concentration of 200 pM with 20% PhiX3. The sequencing program consisted of 241 cycles for Read 1, 6 cycles for Index i7 and 91 cycles for Read 2. The sequencing facility performed demultiplexing of sub-libraries, resulting in eight FASTQ files (R1 and R2 for each index). R1 files contain the cDNA sequences, while R2 files contain the cell barcodes (from the three split-pool rounds) and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs).\n\nFor each index, two paired-end FASTQ files were generated :\n\nR1 contains the cDNA sequence of interest (transcriptome).\nR2 contains the cell barcodes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs).",

    "text": "2.3 Pipeline for microSPLiT data processing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Comprehensive pipeline for microSPLiT single-cell RNA-seq data processing.\n\n\n\nThe workflow encompasses the complete analytical process from raw sequencing data to biological interpretation, including quality control and preprocessing of FASTQ files, alignment and quantification using STARsolo, data structuring with metadata assignment, quality filtering and integration, single-cell and pseudobulk analysis approaches, population characterization through clustering and trajectory inference, and downstream expression analysis including differential expression, co-expression networks, and gene ontology enrichment. Figure 2.4\n\nPreprocessing of the sequencing data\nAll quality control, trimming, alignment, barcode reading and generation of cell-gene count matrix steps were performed on the GenOuest high-performance computing cluster using SLURM job scripts and parallelization to ensure efficient and reproducible analysis of large-scale sequencing data.\n\nQuality control and trimming\nRead quality was initially assessed for all four libraries (R1 and R2) using FastQC4 and MultiQC5. Trimming was then performed with Cutadapt6 and Fastp7 to clean the sequencing data. For R2 files, trimming focused on filtering for valid barcodes. For R1 files, trimming removed various artifacts: template-switching oligo (TSO) sequences at the 5’ end, adapter sequences, and 3’ artifacts including polyG stretches (NovaSeq-specific artifacts) and potential R1 complement sequences when cDNA was short. Only reads with a minimum length of 25 bp were kept. The detailed trimming pipeline is described in Appendix Section Section A.6. After trimming, read quality was reassessed with FastQC4 and MultiQC7, and results were merged into unique files (R1 and R2).\n\n\nQuality control after trimming\nAfter trimming, a quality control step was performed to ensure that the remaining reads were of high quality and suitable for downstream analysis. This step involved checking the distribution of read lengths, GC content, and other relevant metrics.\n\n\nMerge files\nAfter quality control, the files from all four libraries (R1 and R2 for each index) were merged into a single file for each index. This step ensured that all cells from all conditions and technical replicates were included in the analysis.\n\n\nAlignment, barcode reading and generation of cell-gene count matrix\nThe alignment and quantification pipeline was implemented using STARsolo8,9, an extension of the STAR aligner specifically designed for single-cell RNA-seq data. STARsolo was chosen based on benchmarking studies showing it offers the best combination of speed and reproducibility for SPLiT-seq / microSPLiT data analysis10. The implementation followed the recommendations outlined in Gaisser et al1 for optimal microSPLiT data processing. Complete pipeline scripts and parameters are detailed in Appendix Section Section A.7.\nReference genome and annotation. The reference genome of Pseudomonas brassicacearum R401: ASM3006410v1 (GCA_030064105.1) and its annotation were downloaded from GenBank. The GFF3 annotation file was converted to GTF format using gffread (Cufflinks11 package) for compatibility with STARsolo.\nCorrecting GTF file for compatibility with STAR. The conversion was verified to ensure all required fields were present, particularly confirming that genes were labeled as ‘exon’ features rather than ‘CDS’ descriptors, and that chromosome names matched between reference sequence and annotation files. This correction was performed to ensure proper compatibility with STARsolo.\nAlignment parameters. The pipeline used optimized parameters for microSPLiT data: minimum 50 matching bases for valid alignment and 1 mismatch tolerance for both barcode and UMI matching. The complex barcode structure (R2) was configured with positions 0_10_0_17, 0_48_0_55, and 0_78_0_85 for the three barcoding rounds, and UMI position 0_0_0_9.\nOutput matrices. STARsolo generated count matrices using GeneFull feature counting and UniqueAndMult-Uniform mapping strategy (distributes multi-mapped reads uniformly). Although bacteria lack introns, GeneFull was chosen to include reads that may map to intergenic regions or incompletely annotated gene boundaries, which is common in bacterial genomes. The UniqueAndMult-Uniform strategy is particularly important for bacterial genomes due to the presence of paralogous genes, repetitive sequences, and operon structures that can result in reads mapping to multiple genomic locations. Raw data matrices (unfiltered barcodes) were used for downstream analysis1, with cell filtering applied later in the processing pipeline.\nQuality control and output files. After STARsolo analysis, quality control was performed using the Log.final.out and summary.csv files. The main output files for downstream analysis included barcode.tsv (cell identifiers), features.tsv (gene identifiers), and UniqueAndMult-Uniform.mtx (count matrix).\n\n\n\nSingle-cell data processing\nAll downstream analyses were performed locally using a reproducible development container environment (Docker12 and Rocker Project) with Visual Studio Code dev containers to ensure consistent software versions and analysis reproducibility, including version control for R and Python packages.\n\nData conversion and metadata assignment.\nRaw count matrix was converted to Seurat v5 objects13 in R. Two types of metadata were assigned:\n\nCell metadata based on barcode combinations, linking each cell to its experimental condition (medium type, biological and technical replicate, timepoint, and well plate position at each barcoding round)\n\n\n\nGene metadata including sequence type and gene symbols for downstream analysis.\n\nFor Python-based analyses, Seurat objects were converted to AnnData objects14 for use with Scanpy15.\n\n\nQuality control and filtering.\nThe data was processed through quality control and filtering steps. Quality control metrics were calculated for each cell, including total UMI counts and number of detected genes. Cells with low quality metrics or potential contamination were filtered out to ensure robust downstream analysis. Because the reads depth or cell expression is different between : Stress condition (M9F) and non-stress condition (M9) et also between the 3 timepoints (T1, T2, T3) (see suppl figure ) , we decided to filter the cells based on the number of UMI counts per cell (nCounts) and the number of detected genes (nFeatures) per sample.\nCell filtering strategy. For each of the 90 samples (18 conditions × 5 technical replicates), cells were filtered to retain only the top 10% of cells with the highest number of expressed genes (nFeatures) per sample, resulting in 82,080 cells from the initial 820,800 possible cells. This selection strategy ensures that only the highest quality cells from each sample are retained for downstream analysis.\nUMI-based filtering. Following the initial gene-based filtering, cells were further filtered based on UMI counts per cell (nCounts). From each sample, only the best cells were retained to achieve a target of 3,000 cells total across all conditions. This approach maximizes sequencing depth per cell while maintaining representation across all experimental conditions.\nDoublet estimation. Based on the doublet rate of 0.34% reported by Kuchina et al.1, we estimated approximately 10.2 potential doublets among the 3,000 selected cells (0.34 × 3000/100). To remove potential doublets, cells were filtered using arbitrary thresholds: cells with nCount &gt; 5000 or nFeature &gt; 1500 were excluded, as these thresholds typically indicate doublet contamination in single-cell RNA-seq data (3 cells removed).\nGene filtering. Only mRNA sequences were retained for analysis, excluding ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA sequences etc. Additionally, genes were required to be expressed in a minimum of 5 cells to ensure statistical reliability in downstream analyses.\nFinal dataset. After applying these filtering criteria, the final processed dataset contained high-quality single-cell transcriptomes ready for differential expression analysis and cell state characterization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe filtering thresholds used in this study were chosen arbitrarily, as each single-cell RNA-seq study typically defines its own filtering criteria. These choices may have implications for the interpretation of results, particularly regarding the representation of different cell states and the detection of rare cell populations. The potential biases introduced by these filtering strategies will be discussed in the Results and Discussion sections, as this is a common limitation across single-cell RNA-seq studies in the field.\n\n\n-retiré un replica tech aussi (voir annexe ) au total on conserve : x cellules , avec x genes\n\n\n\n\n1.

The cells then undergo an additional RT and template switching step. The template switch primer has two RNA G bases and a locked nucleic acid G base (‘rGrG+G’) sequence to facilitate the binding. c, cDNA is amplified, and size is selected to eliminate the unwanted short product (‘dimer’) from the cDNA amplification product. At this point, the size and concentration of the cDNA product are quantified (Part 2, Step 127). d, The library then undergoes fragmentation and adapter ligation. The desired sequencing product containing the barcodes is amplified with the primers for both the third barcode adapter and the ligation adapter, which contain Read 1 (R1) and Read 2 (R2) sequences.

In the before trimming plot (Figure 3.1 (a)), distinct patterns are visible: polyG stretches (pink), polyA tails (cyan), and Illumina adapter sequences (purple). After trimming (Figure 3.1 (b)), these artifacts are effectively removed, resulting in clean sequence data suitable for downstream analysis. The successful elimination of these technical artifacts demonstrates the effectiveness of the trimming pipeline in improving data quality.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Summary of sequence metrics before and after trimming of each sublibrary with Cutadapt and Fastp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Name\nBC_0076\nBC_0077\nBC_0079\nBC_0080\nMean/Total\n\n\n\n\nR1 length before trimming\n241bp\n241bp\n241bp\n241bp\n241bp\n\n\nR1 length after trimming\n127bp\n157bp\n152bp\n132bp\n142bp\n\n\nR1 number of sequences before trimming\n631.4M\n325.5M\n379.1M\n397.7M\n1733.7M\n\n\nR1 number of sequences after trimming\n450.8M\n248.4M\n285.2M\n300.1M\n1284.5M\n\n\nChange in number of sequences\n-28.6%\n-23.7%\n-24.8%\n-24.5%\n-25.4%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trimming process successfully removed various sequencing artifacts and improved data quality for downstream analysis. The preprocessing pipeline eliminated template-switching oligo (TSO) sequences, polyG stretches (NovaSeq-specific artifacts), polyA tails, and adapter sequences from the raw sequencing data (Figure 3.1, Table 3.1). This cleaning step was essential for accurate gene expression quantification and reliable single-cell analysis.\n\nTrimming Efficiency and Data Retention\nThe trimming process resulted in an average reduction of 25.4% in the total number of sequences across all sublibraries, from 1,733.7 million to 1,284.5 million reads (Table 3.1). This reduction rate is within the expected range for single-cell RNA-seq data and indicates effective removal of low-quality sequences while preserving the majority of informative reads. The final dataset of 1.284 billion reads provides substantial sequencing depth for robust analysis.\n\n\nSub-library Size Variations and Their Implications\nThe four sublibraries showed notable size differences before trimming, ranging from 325.5 million reads (BC_0077) to 631.4 million reads (BC_0076) (Table 3.1). These variations likely reflect differences in library preparation efficiency and sequencing performance across the flowcell. The largest library (BC_0076) exhibited the most significant reduction in read length after trimming (from 241bp to 127bp), suggesting higher levels of sequencing artifacts in this sublibrary (Table 3.1).\n\n\nQuality Improvements and Technical Considerations\nThe trimming process revealed interesting patterns across sublibraries. BC_0076 and BC_0080 showed the most pronounced reductions in R1 read length, which may indicate higher initial quality of these libraries requiring more aggressive trimming to remove artifacts while maintaining better overall data integrity.\nBC_0076 specifically showed earlier and more prominent polyG artifacts, likely due to reagent depletion during sequencing that led to increased G nucleotide incorporation errors. This phenomenon is common in NovaSeq sequencing runs where the largest libraries may experience reagent exhaustion, resulting in higher error rates and more artifacts that require removal during trimming. Despite these technical challenges, the trimming process successfully mitigated these artifacts, resulting in high-quality data suitable for downstream analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations for Future Experiments\n\n\n\nThe observed size variations between sublibraries highlight the importance of balanced library preparation for optimal sequencing efficiency. Libraries of unequal sizes can lead to differential reagent consumption and varying quality across the flowcell. Future experiments should aim for more balanced library sizes to minimize technical artifacts and ensure consistent quality across all sublibraries.\n\n\n\n\nMultiQC Report R1 Before Trimming\n\n\nClick to view MultiQC report R1 before trimming\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiQC Report R1 After Trimming\n\n\nClick to view MultiQC report R1 after trimming\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiQC Report R2 Before Trimming\n\n\nClick to view MultiQC report R2 before trimming\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiQC Report R2 After Trimming\n\n\nClick to view MultiQC report R2 after trimming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTARsolo Analysis and Data Quality Assessment\nOur single-cell RNA-seq data was processed using STARsolo, which provided comprehensive quality metrics and mapping statistics. The analysis revealed excellent data quality suitable for investigating division of labor patterns in P. brassicacearum populations.\n\nSTARsolo Analysis Results\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Comprehensive STARsolo analysis results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nCount/Percentage\nInterpretation\n\n\n\n\nTotal Reads Processed\n1,284,475,633\nHigh sequencing depth\n\n\nReads With Valid Barcodes\n1,099,327,755\n85.58% of total reads\n\n\n- Exact Barcode Match\n1,046,121,284\n81.44%\n\n\n- Single Mismatch Barcode\n53,206,471\n4.14%\n\n\nQ30 Bases in RNA reads\n95.79%\nOutstanding sequencing quality\n\n\nQ30 Bases in CB+UMI\n95.51%\nHigh barcode/UMI quality\n\n\nGeneFull Mapping (Unique + Multiple)\n971,519,404 (75.64%)\nGood gene-level coverage\n\n\nUnique GeneFull Mapping\n34,593,349 (2.69%)\nExpected low rate due to overlapping genes\n\n\nTotal GeneFull Detected\n6,035\nComprehensive gene coverage\n\n\nCell Barcodes Detected\n699,355\nTotal unique barcodes\n\n\nTotal UMIs Detected\n34,258,961\nGood molecular diversity\n\n\nSequencing Saturation\n0.97%\nVery low - potential for deeper sequencing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSequencing Saturation Explanation: Sequencing saturation measures how completely we have sampled the transcriptome. It is calculated as:\nSaturation = 1 - (N_umi / N_reads)\nwhere: - N_umi = number of unique CB/UMI/gene combinations - N_reads = number of reads with valid CB/UMI/gene\nA saturation of 0.97% indicates we could sequence much deeper to capture more unique molecules.\nNote: The low unique mapping rates (3.64% to genome, 2.69% to genes) are typical for bacterial RNA-seq due to the compact nature of bacterial genomes with overlapping coding sequences. The high multiple mapping rate reflects the complexity of bacterial transcriptomes, which is particularly relevant for studying division of labor as it captures the full transcriptional landscape.\n\n\nData Quality Summary for Division of Labor Analysis\nThe STARsolo results provide strong evidence that our data is well-suited for investigating division of labor in P. brassicacearum:\n\nComprehensive Gene Detection: 6,035 genes detected across all cells captures the full transcriptional diversity besoin de verif apres le nombre de genes detectés par cellules , nombre umi … mais avant doit filtrer les cellules\nExcellent Technical Quality: &gt;95% Q30 scores and 85.58% valid barcodes indicate minimal technical noise\nRobust Mapping: 75.64% of reads mapped to genes, providing comprehensive transcriptome coverage\n\nThe low sequencing saturation (0.97%) suggests we could potentially sequence deeper to capture more unique molecules, but the current depth is sufficient for robust division of labor analysis. The high proportion of multiple-mapped reads is expected for bacterial data and actually beneficial for capturing the full complexity of overlapping transcriptional units that may be involved in division of labor processes.\n\n\nGeneFull vs Gene Mapping Strategy\nWe employed the GeneFull mapping approach, which includes: - Coding sequences (CDS) - Untranslated regions (UTRs) - Non-coding RNAs - Intergenic regions\nThis broader mapping strategy is particularly valuable for bacterial division of labor studies as it captures regulatory elements, non-coding RNAs, and intergenic regions that may play crucial roles in phenotypic differentiation and specialization within bacterial populations.\n\n\n\nGenome and Transcriptome Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) genome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) transcriptome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Genome and transcriptome description (obtained with fastqc)\n\n\n\nThe genome and transcriptome composition analysis reveals the distribution of different RNA types in our P. brassicacearum samples. This information is crucial for understanding the transcriptional landscape and identifying potential division of labor patterns, as different RNA types may be differentially expressed across subpopulations.\n\n\nCell Filtering Strategy\nFor our division of labor analysis, we retained all cell barcodes that passed quality control (820,800 barcodes), rather than applying additional filtering thresholds. This approach maximizes our ability to detect rare subpopulations and subtle division of labor patterns that might be missed with more stringent filtering.\nImportant Note on STARsolo Default Filtering: We deliberately did not use STARsolo’s default filtering method (KneePant), which would have resulted in approximately 27,000 cells. This decision was based on the concern that the KneePant method might eliminate stressed cells that could have lower quality metrics compared to non-stressed cells, potentially biasing our division of labor analysis by removing biologically relevant subpopulations.\nThe choice of filtering strategy is complex and context-dependent. As mentioned in the literature, various filtering approaches exist: - Filtering based on read types (global or condition-specific thresholds) - Filtering based on reads per cell - Filtering based on genes expressed per cell - Filtering based on reads per gene\nIn the Kuchina et al. (2021) study, they used a threshold of 200 UMI per cell, but we chose a more inclusive approach to capture the full spectrum of cellular heterogeneity in our P. brassicacearum population.\n\n\nCell Filtering Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Scatter plot of the number of UMI per cell before and after filtering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Violin plot of the number of UMI per cell before and after filtering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Filtering of cells with less than 100 UMI per cell\n\n\n\nThe filtering analysis shows the distribution of UMI counts per cell before and after applying quality thresholds. This visualization helps assess the impact of filtering on our ability to detect division of labor patterns and ensures we maintain sufficient statistical power for downstream analysis.\nKey considerations for division of labor analysis: - The choice of filtering threshold can significantly impact the detection of rare subpopulations - Housekeeping genes and rRNA content may provide insights into growth rate variations across cells - Technical replicates may need to be pooled or analyzed separately depending on experimental design\n\n\nCell Recovery and Expression Profiling\nOur analysis successfully captured a substantial population of bacterial cells with good coverage:\n\n\n\nTable 3.3: Cell-level expression metrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue\nBiological Significance\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Number of Cells\n27,203\nLarge population for DoL analysis\n\n\nMean Reads per Cell\n470\nGood coverage depth\n\n\nMedian Reads per Cell\n381\nConsistent coverage\n\n\nMean UMI per Cell\n465\nReliable molecular counting\n\n\nMedian UMI per Cell\n378\nConsistent UMI distribution\n\n\nMean Genes per Cell\n296\nRich transcriptional profiles\n\n\nMedian Genes per Cell\n258\nConsistent gene detection\n\n\nTotal Genes Detected\n6,035\nComprehensive gene coverage",
