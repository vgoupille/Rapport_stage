    "text": "1.1 Division of Labor: A Fundamental Biological Principle\nThe survival of organisms in evolving environments is driven by their fitness1, where the cost-benefit ratio of traits is constantly balanced and gives rise to different populational evolutionary strategies. To succeed, organisms must compete, cooperate, and/or specialize based on how well their traits enable resource acquisition and utilization in their biotic and abiotic environment. Division of Labor (DoL) represents one such strategy for resource use optimisation. Division of labour occurs when different individuals, cells or tissues become specialised to perform complementary tasks that benefit the whole organism or social group1 and improves collective performance2. This fundamental principle operates throughout biological systems, from molecular evolution where gene duplication enables enzyme specialization, to multicellular organisms where cellular differentiation creates specialized tissues, to eusocial insect societies with their reproductive and functional caste systems3.\nAmong the diverse biological systems where DoL operates, microbial communities provide particularly compelling examples. Microbial communitie’s dynamics demonstrate how DoL can emerge even among unicellular organisms, where individual cells can specialize in different metabolic functions while cooperating for collective benefit. Giri and colleagues have attempted to define the concept of DoL specifically within microbial communities, identifying key criteria that distinguish DoL from other types of ecological interactions3. Microbial interactions can be classified based on their directionality and the species involved. Interactions can be unidirectional or bidirectional, and can occur within the same species (intraspecific) or between different species (interspecific). For an interaction to qualify as DoL, it must involve reciprocal fitness benefits between partners, where both participants gain from the interaction. DoL between microbial species has been well-characterized in various ecosystems, with numerous examples of cross-feeding and mutualistic interactions documented in the human gut microbiome and soil communities4.",

    "text": "1.2 Division of Labor in Root Microbiota\nBuilding on this broader understanding of microbial DoL, the root microbiota represents a particularly well-studied example of interspecific DoL5. Roots of plants host diverse bacteria that are collectively referred to as the bacterial root microbiota. Unlike multicellular organisms that evolved diverse cell types to achieve distinct biological functions and promote a division of labour, unicellular organisms such as bacteria rely on limited metabolic specialisation possibilities as a unit. Indeed, recent reports6,7, indicate that metabolic interdependencies and cross-feeding exchanges are widespread among taxonomically diverse bacteria and likely drive microbial co-existence within complex bacterial communities8,9.\nWhile interspecific DoL has been extensively studied3, intraspecific DoL within clonal/isogenic bacterial populations remains less explored, despite its potential importance for understanding population-level adaptation and functional diversity. The traditional view of biological populations assumed that all individuals within a clonal population behave identically. However, evidence has accumulated over decades showing that even genetically identical organisms can exhibit functional heterogeneity, leading to population-level benefits through task specialization10.\nA major unsolved question is whether populations of genetically identical bacteria can minimise energetically costly processes by each executing different metabolic tasks at the intra-population level. Here, we hypothesise that metabolic cooperation within bacterial populations plays a key role in modulating population dynamics, competitiveness, and persistence at the root–soil interface. This hypothesis builds on the idea that bacteria are subject to stochastic, noisy gene expression11–13. In such systems, not all individuals respond identically to environmental cues, leading to phenotypic heterogeneity. This noise-driven diversity can be beneficial at the population level. The theory of Noise-Averaging Cooperation (NAC)14 further proposes that metabolic noise—exacerbated by the small size of bacteria—can constrain individual growth, but can be mitigated through metabolite sharing among related cells. This “leaky function”, forming a “metabolic marketplace”, allows populations to buffer stochastic fluctuations and improve collective fitness. In this context, cross-feeding interactions may emerge as a result of gene expression variability and/or the selection of advantageous mutations, fostering metabolic interdependencies within the population (see Figure 1.1).\nFinally, environmental regulation also shapes this process: microenvironmental cues and spatial heterogeneity can induce context-dependent gene expression patterns10,15, which, if consistently beneficial, may become genetically encoded over evolutionary time. Altogether, these mechanisms point toward an intra-population division of labour emerging from the interplay between gene expression noise, environmental signals, and evolutionary selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Examples of benefits and sources of intraspecific division of labour between intra-populations based on metabolic complementation and costly “common good” metabolite production.\n\n\n\nFrom the left to the right, co-metabolism within an isogenic bacterial population (A) and production of antimicrobials targeting other bacteria (B) can be considered as division of labour in a population. These mechanisms of division of labour can be based on differential transcription between bacteria (C) within a population and/or genetic variations between intra-populations (D).",

    "text": "1.3 PsR401: A Model System for Studying Intraspecific DoL\nTo investigate these theoretical frameworks of intraspecific DoL, we require a well-characterized bacterial model system that exhibits the complex metabolic interactions described above. Successful establishment of bacteria at roots is driven by multiple independent biological processes involved in both host-microbe (i.e., signal recognition, chemotaxis, surface attachment, biofilm formation, virulence factors)10 and microbe-microbe interactions (i.e., production of antimicrobials or public goods)16. Therefore, we postulate that the simultaneous activation of these diverse processes is costly and that cooperation between genetically identical strains is key for promoting bacterial pervasiveness at roots. Consistent with this hypothesis, it was recently demonstrated that the robust root coloniser Pseudomonas brassicacearum R401 (hereafter referred to as PsR401) deploys multiple independent strategies that co-function to promote colonisation and persistence at roots17. Unlike many pathogenic bacteria, PsR401 lacks genes for a type III secretion system (T3SS) and does not overgrow or suppress plant immune responses18,19. This opportunistic pathogen20 of the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana acts as a potent antagonist that relies on the combined action of three distinct exometabolites to suppress competitors and promote root colonization.\nFirst, this Gram-negative bacterium produces a phytotoxin called Brassicapeptin20,21, which promotes both pathogenicity and root colonization in mono-association experiments with Arabidopsis thaliana. Second, PsR401 synthesizes 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG)17, an antimicrobial compound that directly inhibits competing microbes. Third, it produces pyoverdine17, a siderophore that chelates iron from the environment—an essential but scarce micronutrient in the rhizosphere22.\nIron availability plays a central role in microbial interactions at the root–soil interface. It also delineates iron as a major micronutrient modulating strain competitiveness and proliferation at roots23,24. In iron-limited environments, siderophore-mediated iron scavenging confers a strong competitive advantage by depriving rival microbes of access to this vital resource. Resource competition, especially for iron, thus represents a key mechanism of indirect microbial antagonism. Beyond simply acquiring nutrients, microbes may also sequester them, preventing uptake by others and modulating community composition and function25.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiological Hypothesis\n\n\n\nGiven that iron functions as a public good whose availability becomes rate-limiting in the root compartment and that production of the above-mentioned processes are all modulated by iron availability,26 we propose that division of labour (DoL) among genetically identical PsR401 cells may be reinforced under iron-limiting conditions, such as those found in the root habitat. In such scenarios, phenotypic heterogeneity—whether driven by gene expression noise or environmentally induced regulation—could lead to subpopulations specialising in complementary tasks, such as toxin production, antimicrobial defense, or siderophore-mediated iron acquisition, thereby enhancing population-level fitness.",

    "text": "1.4 Leveraging Single-Cell Transcriptomics to Study DoL\nTo test our biological hypothesis regarding intraspecific DoL in PsR401, we need to examine transcriptional heterogeneity at the single-cell level. Traditionally, studies of bacterial gene expression have relied on bulk RNA sequencing methods, which provide an average view of the transcriptome across a population.27 However, these approaches mask the underlying cell-to-cell variability that is critical for understanding complex bacterial behaviors and adaptations. The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and now multi-omics technologies has provided unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity across various biological systems28–30. Although eukaryotic cells have benefited from scRNA-seq technology since 2009, prokaryotic systems have faced significant implementation delays owing to distinct technical obstacles. These challenges include low RNA content in individual cells, the absence of poly-A tails on bacterial mRNAs, and diverse cell wall structures.27 These factors necessitate the development of specialized techniques for efficient cell lysis, RNA extraction, and mRNA enrichment in bacterial systems. Despite these challenges, recent years have seen significant progress in developing and refining bacterial scRNA-seq methods27,31. These methodological improvements have created novel opportunities to explore bacterial physiology, stress responses, and population dynamics at single-cell resolution.",

    "text": "1.5 Research Objectives and Approach\n\nOur Focus: microSPLiT Technology\nTo address our biological hypothesis regarding intraspecific DoL in PsR401, we will leverage the microSPLiT (microbial Split-Pool Ligation Transcriptomics) technology32,33. This cutting-edge bacterial scRNA-seq method enables high-throughput profiling of individual bacterial cells, providing the resolution necessary to detect transcriptional heterogeneity within clonal populations. By analyzing PsR401 cells under contrasting nutrient conditions—particularly iron-limited versus iron-replete environments—we hope to identify potential subpopulations that specialize in different metabolic tasks (see Figure 1.2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Hypothesis of DoL in PsR401 under iron-limiting conditions\n\n\n\nTesting the division of labor hypothesis in PsR401 under two contrasting conditions: iron-limited and iron-replete environments. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with microSPLiT will enable detection of transcriptional heterogeneity within the population, revealing whether this specialization is driven by gene expression noise or environmentally induced metabolic specialization in both environmental conditions.\n\n\nInternship Goals and Expected Outcomes\nBuilding upon the theoretical framework of intraspecific division of labor and the biological characteristics of PsR401, this internship aims to leverage cutting-edge single-cell transcriptomics to investigate metabolic cooperation within clonal bacterial populations. The primary goal is to validate the microSPLiT technology for bacterial systems while testing our hypothesis that iron limitation promotes functional specialization among genetically identical cells.\nThrough systematic analysis of transcriptional heterogeneity under contrasting iron conditions in culture medium, we expect to uncover whether PsR401 populations exhibit distinct subpopulations with specialized metabolic functions or whether cooperation emerges through noisy gene expression regulation across the population. By examining temporal dynamics of gene expression patterns, we will gain insights into how these cooperative behaviors evolve and stabilize over time. This investigation will provide critical insights into the mechanisms underlying population-level adaptation and resilience, particularly in the context of fluctuating iron availability.\nThe expected outcomes of this research extend beyond understanding PsR401 biology. By establishing robust methodologies for bacterial single-cell transcriptomics, this work will contribute to the broader field of microbial population dynamics.\nUltimately, this project will advance our understanding of how phenotypic diversity among clonal bacterial populations facilitates ecological success and resilience during root colonization, while establishing methodological foundations for future studies of bacterial population dynamics at single-cell resolution.\n\n\n\n\n1.

Each medium condition was replicated three times (Rep A, B, C) and growth was monitored at three timepoints (T1, T2, T3) by optical density measurements. This design resulted in 18 total experimental conditions (2 media × 3 biological replicates × 3 timepoints) for subsequent single-cell RNA-seq analysis.\nAn isogenic1 population of P. brassicacearum R401 was initially cultured on petri dishes and then transferred to different liquid media to investigate the effects of nutrient availability on bacterial growth and gene expression (Figure 2.1).\nTwo distinct culture conditions were applied to the bacteria: M9 medium containing low glucose and low iron concentrations, and M9F medium containing high glucose and high iron concentrations (see Table A.1 for detailed concentrations). Each condition was replicated three times to ensure statistical robustness of the experimental results. The bacterial growth was monitored by measuring optical density (OD) at regular intervals. The growth curves obtained from these measurements are presented (Figure 2.2) and (?tbl-growth-curves). This experimental design resulted in a total of 18 conditions: 2 media types × 3 biological replicates × 3 time points, providing comprehensive coverage of the growth dynamics under different nutrient conditions.\nMeasurements were taken at three timepoints (T1, T2, T3) for three biological replicates (Rep A, B, C).\nThe growth curves reveal distinct patterns between the two culture conditions. Bacteria grown in M9F medium (high glucose and iron) exhibited significantly higher growth rates and reached higher optical densities (OD 0.17-0.21 at T1, 0.59-0.63 at T2, 0.74-0.83 at T3) compared to M9 medium (low glucose and iron) which showed limited growth (OD 0.13 at T1, 0.28-0.33 at T2, 0.26 at T3). While M9F cultures showed continued growth from T2 to T3, the growth rate slowed down during this period, indicating the beginning of transition towards stationary phase. The M9 cultures appeared to reach a growth plateau by T3, while M9F cultures maintained higher densities despite the growth deceleration, suggesting nutrient limitation in the M9 condition. Biological replicates showed excellent reproducibility validating the experimental design.\nCells were collected at each timepoint (T1, T2, T3) from all biological replicates for subsequent single-cell RNA-seq analysis using the Microbial split-pool ligation transcriptomics (microSPLiT) protocol1,2.",

    "text": "2.2 microSPLiT protocol\nMicroSPLiT1,2 is a high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing method for bacteria, capable of profiling transcriptional states in hundreds of thousands of cells per experiment without the need for specialized equipment1,3. Unlike other single-cell RNA-seq approaches that require physical isolation of individual cells (e.g., plate-based or droplet-based methods), microSPLiT uses a split-pool barcoding strategy to uniquely label transcripts within each cell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation\n\n\n\nThe microSPLiT strategy will not be described in detail here; for more information, see Gaisser protocol.1. Only the key steps necessary for a general understanding of the method are presented below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: MicroSPLiT in-cell cDNA barcoding scheme (from Gaisser et al. 2024)1\n\n\n\na, Bacterial cells are fixed overnight and permeabilized before the mRNA is preferentially polyadenylated. After mRNA enrichment, cells may contain both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated mRNA. b, Cells are distributed into the first barcoding plate, and the mRNA is reverse transcribed by using a mixture of poly-dT and random hexamer primers carrying a barcode (barcode 1, BC1) and a 5’ phosphate for future ligation at their 5’ end. After the barcoding reaction, cells are pooled together and split again into the second barcoded plate. c, Ligation adds a 5’ phosphorylated barcode 2 (BC2) to BC1 with a linker strand. A blocking solution is then added to each of the wells of the second plate, preventing any unreacted BC2 from future ligation. Cells are pooled and split into the third and final barcoded plate. d, A second ligation step adds barcode 3 (BC3) with another linker strand. BC3 also contains a 5’ biotin, a primer binding site and a unique molecular identifier (UMI). A blocking solution for the R3 linker is added to each of the wells in the plate before the final pooling of cells. This results in uniquely barcoded cells that can be distributed in aliquots into sub-libraries and stored until future use or used immediately for library preparation. (R1, round 1; R2, round 2; R3, round 3).1\n\nFixation and permeabilization\nThe first step is fixation of the bacterial suspension with formaldehyde Figure 2.3 immediately after sampling the 18 conditions Figure 2.1. This preserves the transcriptomic state and cross-links RNA to proteins, preventing leakage of each cell’s transcriptome. Next, cells are permeabilized using mild detergent and lysozyme, allowing enzymes and oligonucleotides to access intracellular RNA for barcoding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAdequate permeabilization is essential for efficient barcoding, but over-permeabilization can compromise cell integrity. For successful single-cell resolution, cells must remain intact after permeabilization to allow multiple split-pool steps and retain cross-linked RNA. Figure 2.3\n\n\n\n\nmRNA enrichment\nAfter permeabilization, the transcripts in the fixed and permeabilized cells undergo in situ polyadenylation with the addition of a poly(A) polymerase (PAP) and ATP. This step enriches for mRNA in the total barcoded RNA pool because, under these conditions, PAP preferentially polyadenylates mRNA as opposed to ribosomique RNA (rRNA) Figure 2.3.\n\n\nBarcoding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe protocol utilizes several rounds of split-pool barcoding where cells are distributed into 96-well plates, barcoded, pooled, and redistributed for subsequent rounds, creating unique barcode combinations that identify individual cells.\n\n\n\nBarcoding round 1 (R1) to identify the condition and the technical replicate\nEach of the 18 samples is split into 5 technical replicates for barcoding, resulting in 90 subsamples. These technical replicates are then distributed into individual wells of a 96-well plate (6 wells not used), with each well containing uniquely barcoded primers Figure 2.3. In each well, mRNA is reverse transcribed into cDNA using a mix of barcoded poly(T) and random hexamer primers. The primers used in each well contain either a dT15 sequence to capture polyadenylated mRNA or six random nucleotides to bind any RNA, followed by a universal sequence for subsequent ligation steps. By assigning each technical replicate to a specific well, all cells in the same well receive the same unique barcode during reverse transcription. This allows each technical replicate and condition to be identified later based on the first barcode.\n\n\nBarcoding rounds 2 (R2) and 3 (R3) for unique cell and transcript identification\nCells are then pooled, washed and randomly redistributed into a new 96-well plate (round 2 (R2) ligation working plate) containing a second set of well-specific barcodes, which are appended to the first barcode on the cDNA through an in-cell ligation reaction Figure 2.3. Due to the random redistribution of cells, each well of the second-round plate is likely to contain a mix of cells with different first-round barcodes, resulting in highly diverse barcode combinations. The ligation reaction is carried out by the T4 DNA ligase, which requires double-stranded DNA. Therefore, in the second barcoding plate, each barcode is first hybridized to a short linker oligonucleotide whose overhang is complementary to the universal sequence at the 5’ end of the RT barcodes. Figure 2.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAfter the ligation step, some barcodes may remain unreacted in the solution. To prevent these free barcodes from attaching non-specifically to DNA from other cells during pooling, a blocker strand is added. This blocker has a longer complementary region to the linker, allowing it to displace any unreacted barcodes from the linker and thus ensures that only correctly ligated barcodes remain attached to the cDNA. Figure 2.3\n\n\nCells are then pooled again, and a split-ligation-pool cycle is repeated for the second time. Cells are randomly distributed into a third 96-well plate (round 3 (R3) ligation working plate), which is loaded with barcoded oligonucleotides containing the third cell barcode annealed with a linker, a 10-base Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI), a universal PCR handle and a 5’ biotin2 molecule. The ligation reaction is stopped by adding a second blocker strand and EDTA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIn our experiment, only 95 out of the 96 wells of the R3 plate are used to minimize potential bias in cell distribution. This setup allows for 90 × 96 × 95 = 820,800 possible barcode combinations, enabling the identification of up to 820,800 individual cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nSub-library and sequencing preparation\nThe pooled cells are washed, counted, and divided into multiple sub-libraries. Only sub-libraries containing approximately 3,000 cells were selected for sequencing, in order to maximize sequencing depth per cell and minimize barcode collision rates which is the probability that two cells receive the same barcode combination.\nAfter lysis and cDNA purification on streptavidin beads (?fig-protocol-p2), a second reverse transcription is performed to improve cDNA yield, during which a template switch oligo (TSO) is added to introduce a 3’ adapter. The resulting cDNA is then amplified by PCR. Following amplification, a size selection step removes short byproducts such as adapter or barcode dimers, ensuring that only high-quality cDNA fragments are retained for sequencing.\nTo optimize sequencing depth, the final library was split into four sub-libraries, each receiving a distinct index during adapter ligation: BC_0076 (CAGATC), BC_0077 (ACTTGA), BC_0078 (TAGCTT), and BC_0079 (GGCTAC). These indexes were used solely to improve sequencing quality and balance on the NovaSeq platform, without introducing any experimental or technical variation between sub-libraries.\n\n\nSequencing and demultiplexing sub-libraries\nSequencing was performed on a NovaSeqTM X plus instrument at GenoBIRD platform in paired-end mode. The library pool was loaded onto all lanes of the flowcell at a final concentration of 200 pM with 20% PhiX3. The sequencing program consisted of 241 cycles for Read 1, 6 cycles for Index i7 and 91 cycles for Read 2. The sequencing facility performed demultiplexing of sub-libraries, resulting in eight FASTQ files (R1 and R2 for each index). R1 files contain the cDNA sequences, while R2 files contain the cell barcodes (from the three split-pool rounds) and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs).\n\nFor each index, two paired-end FASTQ files were generated :\n\nR1 contains the cDNA sequence of interest (transcriptome).\nR2 contains the cell barcodes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs).",

    "text": "2.3 Pipeline for microSPLiT data processing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Comprehensive pipeline for microSPLiT single-cell RNA-seq data processing.\n\n\n\nThe workflow encompasses the complete analytical process from raw sequencing data to biological interpretation, including quality control and preprocessing of FASTQ files, alignment and quantification using STARsolo, data structuring with metadata assignment, quality filtering and integration, single-cell and pseudobulk analysis approaches, population characterization through clustering and trajectory inference, and downstream expression analysis including differential expression, co-expression networks, and gene ontology enrichment.\n\nPreprocessing of the sequencing data\nAll quality control, trimming, alignment, barcode reading and generation of cell-gene count matrix steps were performed on the GenOuest high-performance computing cluster using SLURM job scripts and parallelization to ensure efficient and reproducible analysis of large-scale sequencing data (see left part of Figure 2.4).\n\nQuality control and trimming\nRead quality was initially assessed for all four libraries (R1 and R2) using FastQC4 and MultiQC5. Trimming was then performed with Cutadapt6 and Fastp7 to clean the sequencing data. For R2 files, trimming focused on filtering for valid barcodes. For R1 files, trimming removed various artifacts: template-switching oligo (TSO) sequences at the 5’ end, adapter sequences, and 3’ artifacts including polyG stretches (NovaSeq-specific artifacts) and potential R1 complement sequences when cDNA was short. Only reads with a minimum length of 25 bp were kept. The detailed trimming pipeline is described in Appendix Section Section A.2. After trimming, read quality was reassessed with FastQC4 and MultiQC7, and results were merged into unique files (R1 and R2).\n\n\nQuality control after trimming\nAfter trimming, a quality control step was performed to ensure that the remaining reads were of high quality and suitable for downstream analysis. This step involved checking the distribution of read lengths, GC content, and other relevant metrics.\n\n\nMerge files\nAfter quality control, the files from all four libraries (R1 and R2 for each index) were merged into a single file for each index. This step ensured that all cells from all conditions and technical replicates were included in the analysis.\n\n\nAlignment, barcode reading and generation of cell-gene count matrix\nThe alignment and quantification pipeline was implemented using STARsolo8,9, an extension of the STAR aligner specifically designed for single-cell RNA-seq data. STARsolo was chosen based on benchmarking studies showing it offers the best combination of speed and reproducibility for SPLiT-seq / microSPLiT data analysis10. The implementation followed the recommendations outlined in Gaisser et al1 for optimal microSPLiT data processing. Complete pipeline scripts and parameters are detailed in Appendix Section Section A.3.\nReference genome and annotation. The reference genome of Pseudomonas brassicacearum R401: ASM3006410v1 (GCA_030064105.1) and its annotation were downloaded from GenBank. The GFF3 annotation file was converted to GTF format using gffread (Cufflinks11 package) for compatibility with STARsolo.\nCorrecting GTF file for compatibility with STAR. The conversion was verified to ensure all required fields were present, particularly confirming that genes were labeled as ‘exon’ features rather than ‘CDS’ descriptors, and that chromosome names matched between reference sequence and annotation files. This correction was performed to ensure proper compatibility with STARsolo.\nAlignment parameters. The pipeline used optimized parameters for microSPLiT data: minimum 50 matching bases for valid alignment and 1 mismatch tolerance for both barcode and UMI matching. The complex barcode structure (R2) was configured with positions 0_10_0_17, 0_48_0_55, and 0_78_0_85 for the three barcoding rounds, and UMI position 0_0_0_9.\nOutput matrices. STARsolo generated count matrices of gene counts for each cell (N-by-K matrix, with N cells and K genes) using GeneFull feature counting and UniqueAndMult-Uniform mapping strategy (which distributes multi-mapped reads uniformly). Although bacteria lack introns, GeneFull was chosen to include reads that may map to intergenic regions or incompletely annotated gene boundaries, which is common in bacterial genomes. The UniqueAndMult-Uniform strategy is particularly important for bacterial genomes due to the presence of paralogous genes, repetitive sequences, and operon structures that can result in reads mapping to multiple genomic locations. Raw data matrices (unfiltered barcodes) were used for downstream analysis1, with cell filtering applied later in the processing pipeline.\nQuality control and output files. After STARsolo analysis, quality control was performed using the Log.final.out and summary.csv files. The main output files for downstream analysis included barcode.tsv (cell identifiers), features.tsv (gene identifiers), and UniqueAndMult-Uniform.mtx (count matrix).\n\n\n\nSingle-cell data processing\nAll downstream analyses were performed locally using a reproducible development container environment (Docker12 and Rocker Project) with Visual Studio Code dev containers to ensure consistent software versions and analysis reproducibility, including version control for R and Python packages.\n\nData conversion and metadata assignment.\nRaw count matrix was converted to Seurat v5 objects13 in R and AnnData objects14 for use with Scanpy15. Two types of metadata were assigned:\n\nCell metadata based on barcode combinations, linking each cell to its experimental condition (medium type, biological and technical replicate, timepoint, and well plate position at each barcoding round)\nGene metadata including sequence type and gene symbols for downstream analysis.\n\n\n\nQuality control and filtering.\nA multi-step filtering strategy was implemented to ensure data quality and remove technical artifacts while preserving biological variation. The filtering pipeline was designed to address specific challenges of microSPLiT data and experimental design considerations.\nInitial UMI-based filtering. Cells with fewer than 100 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were excluded from the analysis. This threshold was chosen based on preliminary analysis showing clear differences in UMI distributions between the two culture conditions (M9 vs M9F), while also serving as a quality control metric to identify potentially failed technical replicates.\nDoublet removal. To identify potential doublets, the top-performing cells from each technical replicate were first filtered based on UMI counts. The distribution of UMI counts per cell was examined within these high-quality cells to detect outliers that deviated significantly from the expected distribution, which typically represent potential doublets or technical artifacts (visual inspection of the distribution of UMI counts per cell). A comprehensive list of these putative doublets was compiled and subsequently removed from the initial dataset to ensure data quality.\nBiological replicate-based filtering. To ensure robust representation of each experimental condition, filtering was applied at the biological replicate level to obtient approxymaly 165 cells per condition, that represente a total of 3000 cells. For each biological replicate at each optical density timepoint (T1, T2, T3) for both culture conditions (M9, M9F), only the most deeply sequenced cells were retained. This approach allowed for the selection of the best-performing technical replicates. Then, in each of the 18 conditions, technical replicates containing fewer than 5 cells were removed.\nTranscript type filtering. Only mRNA transcripts were retained for analysis, filtering out ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and other non-coding RNA species.\nGene expression filtering. Genes expressed in fewer than 5 cells across the entire dataset were removed to eliminate low-quality or spurious gene detection events and focus on robustly detected transcripts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe filtering thresholds used in this study were chosen arbitrarily, as each single-cell RNA-seq study typically defines its own filtering criteria. These choices may have implications for the interpretation of results, particularly regarding the representation of different cell states and the detection of rare cell populations. The potential biases introduced by these filtering strategies will be discussed in the Results and Discussion sections, as this is a common limitation across single-cell RNA-seq studies in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle-cell analysis\nFor this first approach to single-cell RNA-seq analysis, the complete dataset with all conditions pooled together was analyzed, rather than focusing on specific sub-conditions (Culture Medium × Biological Replicate × Sampling Time). The primary objective was to validate that the dataset contains sufficient signal to distinguish between culture media conditions at a global level before conducting more detailed condition-specific analyses. While the main biological question is to investigate Division of Labor (DoL) within the bacterial population, this approach did not directly address this question but served as a foundation for understanding data quality and taking a broad exploratory view of the data.\n\nGeneral analytical approach\nThe analysis workflow encompassed several key steps: Normalization and scaling, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and differential expression analysis. We systematically tested different parameters and methodologies to optimize each step of the pipeline. We followed the Scanpy tutorial for the general approach and implemented the BacSC protocol (preprint16), a computational pipeline designed to limit methodological biases in bacterial single-cell analysis. We tested BacSC specifically for normalization, scaling and feature selection, and its output was then used for subsequent dimensionality reduction and clustering steps.\nNormalization, scaling and feature selection. We implemented the BacSC protocol (currently a preprint16), a fully data-driven computational pipeline based on the Python version of Seurat’s SCTransform tool. SCTransform is an advanced normalization method that replaces the classical steps of normalization + log-transformation + variable gene selection. It performs variance stabilizing transformation (VST) to correct for differences in sequencing depth between cells, stabilizes variance across genes, and automatically identifies the most informative genes for biological variation. This automated pipeline selects optimal features for normalization and feature selection without requiring manual intervention.\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA). PCA was computed using sc.pp.pca, with the number of principal components systematically tested at multiple levels (i.e. 3, 10, 20, 50) depending on the data characteristics. The optimal number of components was determined using Scanpy’s sc.pl.pca_variance_ratio plot, which displays the explained variance ratio for each principal component, allowing us to identify the elbow point where additional components provide diminishing returns in variance explanation.\nClustering and visualization. We computed shared nearest neighbor graphs using sc.pp.neighbors and tested multiple clustering algorithms including Leiden clustering (sc.tl.leiden) with different resolution parameters (i.e. 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0) to identify the optimal clustering granularity. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was computed using sc.tl.umap for visualization, with parameters optimized for bacterial single-cell data. For comparison and validation purposes, we also performed the same analytical workflow using Seurat v5, which yielded similar results and performance, confirming the robustness of our analytical approach across different computational frameworks.\nDifferential expression analysis\nDifferential gene expression analysis was performed using Scanpy’s gene ranking functions (sc.tl.rank_genes_groups and sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df) to compare expression patterns between experimental conditions. Statistical outputs included gene names, z-scores, log fold changes, p-values, and adjusted p-values for robust identification of differentially expressed genes.\n\n\n\nAnalytical scope and limitations\nAs mentioned in the pipeline description (Figure 2.4), this study focuses on the fundamental analytical steps: data quality assessment, basic clustering and visualization, and initial differential expression analysis between culture conditions. The more advanced analytical approaches such as pseudobulk analysis, trajectory inference, gene co-expression networks, and gene ontology enrichment were not pursued at this exploratory stage.\n\n\n\n\n1.

In the before trimming plot (Figure 3.1 (a)), distinct patterns are visible: polyG stretches (pink), polyA tails (cyan), and Illumina adapter sequences (purple). After trimming (Figure 3.1 (b)), these artifacts are effectively removed, resulting in clean sequence data suitable for downstream analysis. The successful elimination of these technical artifacts demonstrates the effectiveness of the trimming pipeline in improving data quality.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Summary of sequence metrics before and after trimming of each sublibrary with Cutadapt and Fastp (R1 read length metrics)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Name\nBC_0076\nBC_0077\nBC_0079\nBC_0080\nMean/Total\n\n\n\n\nR1 length before trimming\n241bp\n241bp\n241bp\n241bp\n241bp\n\n\nR1 length after trimming\n127bp\n157bp\n152bp\n132bp\n142bp\n\n\nR1 number of sequences before trimming\n631.4M\n325.5M\n379.1M\n397.7M\n1733.7M\n\n\nR1 number of sequences after trimming\n450.8M\n248.4M\n285.2M\n300.1M\n1284.5M\n\n\nChange in number of sequences\n-28.6%\n-23.7%\n-24.8%\n-24.5%\n-25.4%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrimming Efficiency and Data Retention\nThe trimming process successfully removed various sequencing artifacts and improved data quality for downstream analysis. The preprocessing pipeline eliminated template-switching oligo (TSO) sequences, polyG stretches (NovaSeq-specific artifacts), polyA tails, and adapter sequences from the raw sequencing data (Figure 3.1, Table 3.1). This cleaning step was essential for accurate gene expression quantification and reliable single-cell analysis. The trimming process resulted in an average reduction of 25.4% in the total number of sequences across all sublibraries, from 1,733.7 million to 1,284.5 million reads (Table 3.1). This reduction rate is within the expected range for single-cell RNA-seq data and indicates effective removal of low-quality sequences while preserving the majority of informative reads.\n\n\nSub-library Size Variations and Technical Considerations\nThe four sublibraries showed notable size differences before trimming, ranging from 325.5 million reads (BC_0077) to 631.4 million reads (BC_0076) (Table 3.1). These variations likely reflect differences in library preparation efficiency and sequencing performance across the flowcell. The largest library (BC_0076) exhibited the most significant reduction in read length after trimming (from 241bp to 127bp), suggesting higher levels of sequencing artifacts in this sublibrary.\nBC_0076 specifically showed earlier and more prominent polyG artifacts, likely due to reagent depletion during sequencing that led to increased G nucleotide incorporation errors. This phenomenon is common in NovaSeq sequencing runs where the largest libraries may experience reagent exhaustion, resulting in higher error rates and more artifacts that require removal during trimming. Despite these technical challenges, the trimming process successfully mitigated these artifacts, resulting in high-quality data suitable for downstream analysis.\n\n\n\nTranscriptome Description after STARsolo processing\nFollowing the successful preprocessing and trimming of our sequencing data, we performed alignment against the reference genome of P. brassicacearum R401 (Figure 3.2 (a)). The barcode reading and quantification by STARsolo provided comprehensive quality metrics and mapping statistics.\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Summary of metrics obtained with STARsolo after barcode-UMI reading and alignment with the reference genome of P. brassicacearum R401\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nCount/Percentage\n\n\n\n\nTotal Reads Processed\n1,284,475,633\n\n\nN_reads with valid barcodes\n1,099,327,755 (85.58%)\n\n\n- Exact Barcode Match\n-&gt; 1,046,121,284 (81.44%)\n\n\n- Single Mismatch Barcode\n-&gt; 53,206,471 (4.14%)\n\n\nQ30 Bases in RNA reads\n95.79%\n\n\nQ30 Bases in CB+UMI\n95.51%\n\n\nUnique Gene Mapping\n34,593,349 (2.69%)\n\n\nUnique + Multiple Gene Mapping\n971,519,404 (75.64%)\n\n\nTotal Genes Detected\n6,035 on the total of 6,249 genes (96.57%)\n\n\nCell Barcodes Detected\n699,355\n\n\nN_umi\n36,565,214\n\n\nSequencing Saturation\n0.97\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetrics obtained with STARsolo after barcode-UMI reading and alignment with the reference genome of P. brassicacearum R401.\n\nBarcode Quality and Cell Identification\nThe STARsolo analysis processed the 1.284 billion trimmed reads and successfully identified 1.099 billion reads with valid barcodes (85.58% of total reads), demonstrating excellent barcode quality (Table 3.2). Among these, 81.44% had exact barcode matches and 4.14% had single mismatches, indicating robust cell identification. The sequencing quality was outstanding with Q30 scores above 95% for both RNA reads and barcode/UMI sequences. This high percentage of valid barcodes falls within the expected range of 70-90% for successful experiments, as recommended by Gaisser et al. (2024)1, indicating excellent library preparation and barcoding efficiency.\n\n\nGene Mapping and Detection\nGene mapping analysis revealed that 75.64% of reads mapped to genes, with 2.69% showing unique mapping and the remainder showing multiple mapping, which is typical for bacterial genomes with overlapping genes and repeated sequences. The fraction of uniquely aligned reads (2.69%) falls within the expected range of 3-12% for bacterial samples1. A total of 6,035 genes were detected across 699,355 unique cell barcodes, representing 96.6% of the 6,249 genes (Figure 3.2 (a)) annotated in the P. brassicacearum R401 genome.\n\n\nSequencing Saturation and Coverage Assessment\nThe sequencing saturation, calculated as:\n Sequencing\\ Saturation = 1 - \\frac{N_{\\text{umi}}}{N_{\\text{reads with valid barcodes}}} = 1 - \\frac{36,565,214}{1,099,327,755} = 0.97 \n\nWhere:\n\nN_{\\text{umi}} = number of unique molecules detected, distinct combinations of Cell Barcode (CB) / UMI / gene\nN_{\\text{reads}} = total number of reads with valid CB/UMI/gene combinations\n\n\nThis high saturation value of 0.97 could indicate either excellent transcriptome coverage or technical artifacts. While a saturation of &gt;= 0.7 typically indicates sufficient coverage according to Gaisser et al. (2024)1, such high values may also result from technical issues including: (1) inefficient RNA capture leading to limited transcript diversity, (2) PCR amplification bias concentrating reads on few UMIs. The interpretation of this saturation value should be considered alongside other quality metrics such as UMIs per cell and genes detected to distinguish between biological reality and technical artifacts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) genome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) transcriptome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Compositional analysis of P. brassicacearum R401 genome annotation and transcriptome distribution of different RNA types\n\n\n\n\n\nGenome and Transcriptome Composition\nThe genome and transcriptome composition analysis reveals the distribution of different RNA types in our P. brassicacearum sample (Figure 3.2). In the annotated genome of P. brassicacearum R401, we identified 6,100 mRNA genes (97.6% of total genes), 65 tRNA genes (1.1% of total genes), 16 rRNA genes (0.3%) and 68 other genes. However, in the transcriptome analysis of our 36,565,214 UMIs, the distribution shows a different pattern: 57.1% correspond to mRNA transcripts (21 millions), while 28.4% are rRNA transcripts (representing approximately 10 millions UMIs), 10.2% are tRNA transcripts (representing approximately 4 millions UMIs) and 4.4% are other genes (representing approximately 1.5 millions UMIs). This distribution concords with the well-established observation that rRNA and tRNA transcripts represent a large proportion of the bacterial transcriptome despite constituting only a small fraction of the genome, due to their high transcriptional activity and stability2.\n\n\nCell Barcode Detection and Filtering Strategy\nSTARsolo detected 699,355 out of 820,800 possible barcode combinations. Given that our sublibrary was designed to target approximately 3,000 cells, the observed number of barcodes is within the expected range. The presence of additional barcodes likely represents contamination that can occur throughout the protocol, including potential contamination in the source oligonucleotide plates.\nTo identify genuine cells among the total barcode population, STARsolo employs a knee plot strategy3. As recommended in the literature (Gaisser et al. 20241), we chose to apply our own filtering criteria rather than using STARsolo’s default KneePant method, which would have resulted in approximately 27,000 cells. This decision was based on the concern that the KneePant method might eliminate stressed cells that could have lower quality metrics compared to non-stressed cells, potentially biasing our division of labor analysis by removing biologically relevant subpopulations.\nThe high sequencing saturation value of 0.97 requires careful interpretation, as it could reflect either excellent transcriptome coverage or technical artifacts. Before proceeding with division of labor analysis, we will assess this value alongside other quality metrics and filter the barcodes to retain only genuine cells, as the current dataset contains a large number of contaminating barcodes that could mask the biological signal of interest.",

    "text": "3.2 Cell quality filtering and dataset characterization\nFollowing the initial UMI-based filtering (see Section A.4), which revealed clear differences between culture conditions with M9 medium (nutrient-limited) showing fewer retained barcodes compared to M9F (nutrient-rich), additional quality control steps were applied including doublet removal, biological replicate-based filtering, and mRNA type filtering. The final dataset contained approximately 3,000 cells, representing the highest-quality cells selected from each biological replicate to ensure balanced representation across experimental conditions.\nThe filtering by biological replicate shows that some technical replicates were partially or completely eliminated to retain only the best-performing ones. The distribution of retained cells shows approximately 160 cells per biological replicate (Figure 3.3 (a)). When few technical replicate categories remain for a biological replicate, it indicates high variability between technical replicates, likely due to differential barcode efficiency since each technical replicate possesses different barcode 1 combinations (Figure 3.3 (a)). Some technical replicates were more efficient than others (e.g., M9F A sampling T2 had one technical replicate that was much more efficient than its group and therefore almost the only one for which cells passed the filter). Following this filtering, technical replicates are no longer considered for subsequent analyses, and we focus on the biological replicate level.\nThe following visualizations also show the distribution of mRNA gene expression patterns across the filtered cell population, specifically the number of mRNA genes detected per cell and the number of UMIs associated with mRNA genes per cell Figure 3.3 (b), Figure 3.3 (c), Figure 3.3 (d).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Number of cell barcodes retained for each biological replicate (with technical replicates indicated within each bar) across different culture conditions and timepoints after final filtering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Distribution of UMI counts for mRNA genes per cell across culture conditions after final filtering (with technical replicates indicated by specific colors)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Distribution of mRNA gene numbers per cell across culture conditions after final filtering (with technical replicates indicated by specific colors)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Relationship between UMI counts and mRNA gene counts per cell in the final filtered dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Metrics of filtered cells across experimental conditions (Culture Medium × Biological Replicate × Sampling Time) in the single-cell RNA-seq experiment.\n\n\n\nM9F medium consistently showed higher values compared to M9 (Figure 3.3 (d)), with mean mRNA counts of 749 for M9F versus 372 for M9, and mean gene counts of 462 for M9F versus 270 for M9.\nBiological replicate variability was particularly pronounced at T1 for both conditions and at T3 for M9 conditions Figure 3.3 (b), Figure 3.3 (c). Under nutrient-limited conditions (M9), cells showed markedly reduced transcriptional activity at T2 and T3 timepoints, with some replicates displaying very low UMI and gene counts, suggesting either reduced cellular activity or technical challenges in recovering stressed cells. The scatter plot (Figure 3.3 (d)) reveals a strong positive correlation between UMI counts and mRNA gene numbers, confirming the quality of the filtered dataset and the relationship between sequencing depth and gene detection.\nThese results demonstrate that the filtering strategy effectively removed poor-quality barcodes to retain only potential “real cells” from each biological replicate that can be analyzed for downstream investigation.",

    "text": "3.3 Dimensionality Reduction and Transcriptional Heterogeneity Analysis\nFollowing the quality filtering steps, we performed dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to explore transcriptional heterogeneity across cell populations and assess global differences between culture conditions. The analysis began with data transformation using the Bacsc method (see Figure B.1 (b) for detailed about it), followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the optimal number of dimensions for downstream analysis. UMAP visualization and clustering were then used to detect global transcriptional differences between experimental conditions.\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Unsupervised PCA projection highlighting transcriptional heterogeneity across experimental conditions. Cells are colored by culture medium, biological replicate (grouped or not) at specific timepoint, and total mRNA contents. (i.e. nomenclature: M9F_A_T1 corresponds to biological replicate A of M9F at sampling time 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Heatmap of the top contributing genes (top 20) to the first principal components (PC1), based on scaled expression values (z-score per gene). Rows represent genes, columns represent single cells collected at each timepoints for all biological replicates. The legend at the right side of the heatmap shows the full name of the genes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) results showing transcriptional heterogeneity and gene contribution patterns in P. brassicacearum populations\n\n\n\nThe PCA analysis revealed a characteristic pattern of low variance explained by individual principal components (Figure B.1 (b)), which is typical for bacterial single-cell RNA-seq data, particularly under stress conditions. PC1 captured approximately 0.6% of the total variance and dominated the other components, which showed even lower contributions. This indicates that the transcriptional variability is diffuse or weakly structured in the dataset. In this context, for the next analysis we chose to retain the first 5 PCs for UMAP embedding to capture the few potentially meaningful signals carried by the leading components while avoiding the integration of excessive noise. This selection provides a balance between maintaining minimal expressiveness for dimensionality reduction and exercising caution given the low inherent structure of the data.\nPC1 successfully distinguished between the two culture conditions (M9 and M9F), revealing distinct transcriptional patterns (Figure 3.4 (a)). In fact, we can see that M9 T2 and M9 T3 samples (brown and purple points in the Sampling Time facet, top right) were clearly separated from other conditions, while M9 T1 showed no significant difference from M9F conditions. We can also abserve this on the heatmaps (Figure 3.4 (b)). This suggests that cells in M9 medium at T1 may not yet be experiencing stress, possibly due to residual iron availability in the medium at this early timepoint.\nNotably, M9 samples positioned on the left side of PC1 showed greater dispersion compared to those on the right. Furthermore, PC1 axis alignment followed a gradient of total mRNA concentration per cell, suggesting that this component primarily captures differences in overall transcriptional activity between conditions.\n\nGene Contribution Analysis to PC1\nThe heatmap analysis with z-score scaling (ranging from 0 to 1) revealed the genes contributing most significantly to PC1 variance (Figure 3.4 (b)). Each row represents a gene and each column represents a cell, with the legend at the bottom corresponding to biological replicates.\nThe genes contributing most to PC1 variance were primarily associated with translational regulation and iron metabolism, reflecting the stress response to iron limitation in M9 medium. Among the translational regulators, we identified rpsA (30S ribosomal protein S1), raiA (ribosome-associated translation inhibitor), and htpG (HSP90 protein chaperone). HtpG, as a molecular chaperone, plays an indirect but essential role in the biosynthesis and functionality of siderophores. For example, HtpG facilitates the correct folding and stability of enzymes involved in siderophore synthesis, such as those participating in yersiniabactine production in Yersinia species4.\nNotably, porphobilinogen synthase was also identified among the top 20 genes contributing to PC1 variance. This finding is particularly relevant given our experimental design using iron-limited M9 medium. In bacteria, the link between porphobilinogen (PBG) and iron is essential for heme synthesis, a cofactor indispensable for many proteins involved in metabolism, cellular respiration, and electron transport. The biosynthesis of heme in bacteria follows a pathway similar to eukaryotes, with PBG being a key intermediate formed by the condensation of two delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) molecules, catalyzed by porphobilinogen synthase. This process is regulated by iron availability in bacterial cells5. The differential expression of porphobilinogen synthase between M9 and M9F conditions thus reflects the cellular adaptation to iron stress.\nThe analysis also identified TonB-dependent siderophore receptors, which are essential for high-affinity iron acquisition in gram-negative bacteria. These outer membrane-localized proteins bind iron chelates at the cell surface and promote their uptake6,7. Together with porphobilinogen synthase, these genes form a coherent transcriptional response to iron limitation, explaining the clear separation of M9 conditions along PC1.\nWhile PC1 primarily captured differences in transcriptional activity and stress response, PC2 revealed distinct patterns related to cellular motility and chemotaxis (Figure B.1 (d)). For example, methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) and flagellin genes were identified as major contributors to PC2 variance, suggesting a role in chemotaxis and motility responses to environmental conditions.\n\n\n\n\nUMAP Visualization and Clustering Analysis\nFollowing the PCA analysis, we performed UMAP visualization and clustering analysis to explore transcriptional heterogeneity across cell populations and assess global differences between culture conditions.\nWe constructed the neighborhood graph using the first 5 principal components (PCs) with 10 neighbors per cell, capturing local similarity between cells in the reduced dimensional space. This approach is essential for downstream clustering and visualization analyses. We then applied Leiden clustering with two different resolution parameters (0.1 and 0.25) to identify distinct cell populations.\nThe clustering analysis with resolution 0.1 identified two main clusters, while resolution 0.25 revealed three clusters (Figure 3.5 (b)). Both clustering approaches successfully separated the experimental conditions, with M9 T2 and M9 T3 samples clearly distinguished from other conditions. This separation aligns with the PCA results, confirming the distinct transcriptional profiles of cells under iron-limited conditions at later timepoints.\n\nDifferential Expression Analysis Between Clusters\nTo characterize the transcriptional differences between the identified clusters, we performed differential expression analysis between the two clusters obtained with resolution 0.1. We used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test with FDR correction (p &lt; 0.05) to identify significantly differentially expressed genes. The complete results of this analysis are presented in the appendix.\nGroup 0 (primarily M9 T2 and T3 cells) exhibited globally lower expression levels compared to Group 1 (primarily M9F and M9 T1 cells), which showed a more heterogeneous expression gradient (Figure 3.5 (b)). This pattern reflects the reduced transcriptional activity observed in cells under iron stress conditions.\n\n\nCharacterization of Differentially Expressed Genes\nAmong the significantly differentially expressed genes, we identified three representative examples that illustrate the distinct transcriptional programs between clusters:\nRplA (30S ribosomal protein L1): This ribosomal protein showed lower expression in Group 0 compared to Group 1. RplA is constitutively expressed as it is essential for protein synthesis, with expression levels reflecting the cell’s translational activity. Higher expression typically indicates active protein synthesis during rapid growth, while lower expression suggests reduced translational activity under stress conditions.\nQLH64-28090 (phasin): This gene showed the opposite pattern, with higher expression in Group 1 compared to Group 0. Phasins are multifunctional proteins associated with polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) granules that play crucial roles in stress response and energy metabolism8. They form an interface between the hydrophobic PHA granules and the hydrophilic cytoplasm, regulating both PHA accumulation and utilization. Under stress conditions, phasins can activate PHA depolymerization to release energy metabolites, increase PHA synthase activity, and participate in granule segregation. Additionally, some phasins exhibit chaperone-like properties, protecting cellular proteins against stress-induced denaturation and oxidative damage. The differential expression of this phasin gene between clusters suggests distinct metabolic adaptations to iron limitation, with cells potentially modulating their storage metabolism, stress response mechanisms, and protein protection strategies.\nFlagellin: This housekeeping gene, which was the most highly expressed gene in the raw data matrix, also showed differential expression between clusters, with higher expression in Group 1 compared to Group 0. #### Global Expression Patterns and Cluster Heterogeneity\nHowever, the analysis revealed significant heterogeneity within each cluster, with groups of cells showing distinct expression patterns for specific genes compared to the global cluster average. This heterogeneity is particularly evident in the violin plots presented in the appendix, which show variable distributions of gene expression within clusters. In the heatmap representing top significant differentially expressed genes, we can see that some genes are expressed at very high levels, particularly among the significant genes for cluster 1. This observation suggests the presence of specialized subpopulations within the broader transcriptional groups, potentially indicating fine-grained division of labor mechanisms at the cellular level.\nAll three representative genes (RplA, QLH64-28090, and flagellin) showed variable expression between clusters. This global pattern reflects the overall transcriptional differences between stress conditions (M9 T2/T3) and control conditions (M9F and M9 T1). However, this coarse-grained clustering approach may mask important biological heterogeneity within each condition and timepoint.\nThe current analysis provides a global representation of transcriptional differences between major experimental groups, but to address our original biological question about division of labor mechanisms, we need to examine finer-scale heterogeneity. This requires descending to the level of individual culture mediums, conditions, and biological replicates at each timepoint to identify potential subpopulations that could reveal specialized cellular functions and division of labor patterns within the P. brassicacearum population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) UMAP visualization of the single-cell RNA-seq data, colored by culture medium, biological replicate (grouped or not) at specific timepoint, and total mRNA contents.

See the pipeline script for implementation details.\n\n\n\nSTARsolo KneePant filtering results\nAs a comparison to our custom filtering approach, we also analyzed the data using STARsolo’s default KneePant filtering method. The following table presents the results obtained with this alternative filtering strategy:\n\n\n\nTable A.2: STARsolo KneePant filtering results for comparison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nValue\nBiological Significance\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Number of Cells\n27,203\nLarge population for DoL analysis\n\n\nMean Reads per Cell\n470\nGood coverage depth\n\n\nMedian Reads per Cell\n381\nConsistent coverage\n\n\nMean UMI per Cell\n465\nReliable molecular counting\n\n\nMedian UMI per Cell\n378\nConsistent UMI distribution\n\n\nMean Genes per Cell\n296\nRich transcriptional profiles\n\n\nMedian Genes per Cell\n258\nConsistent gene detection\n\n\nTotal Genes Detected\n6,035\nComprehensive gene coverage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults obtained using STARsolo’s default KneePant filtering method. This approach would have resulted in approximately 27,000 cells with higher average coverage per cell, but potentially at the cost of removing biologically relevant stressed cells that might exhibit lower quality metrics. In contrast, our custom filtering approach was specifically designed to target approximately 3,000 high-quality cells across all experimental conditions, prioritizing balanced representation of each condition\nThe KneePant method applies a knee plot analysis to identify the inflection point in the barcode rank plot, automatically determining the threshold between genuine cells and background noise. While this method provides a standardized approach to cell filtering, it may not be optimal for division of labor analysis where stressed cells with potentially lower quality metrics could represent important biological subpopulations. Our targeted approach of ~3,000 cells ensures sufficient statistical power for differential expression analysis while maintaining balanced representation across all experimental conditions (2 media × 3 biological replicates × 3 timepoints).",

This threshold was chosen to remove very low-quality barcodes and to demonstrate clear differences in UMI distributions between the two culture conditions (M9 vs M9F), with M9 losing more BCs at this threshold, while also serving as a quality control metric to identify potentially failed technical replicates. The filtering revealed significant heterogeneity between conditions, with M9 medium showing fewer retained barcodes compared to M9F. This difference could reflect lower transcriptional activity under nutrient-limited conditions, but may also be related to other factors such as cell wall modifications affecting permeabilization efficiency, or increased cell death leading to differential recovery during washing steps. Additionally, technical replicates showed varying sensitivity to filtering, indicating heterogeneity in the ability to recover reads across different experimental batches. Notably, one technical replicate (replicate 3 of M9_C at T3) appeared to have failed, likely due to a pipetting error, and was consequently eliminated by this threshold.",
