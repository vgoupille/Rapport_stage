TLDR: A powerful, high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) platform for yeasts that permits researchers to leverage {\textquotedblleft}the awesome power of yeast{\textquotedblright} by allowing them to survey the transcriptome of hundreds of strains and environments in a short period of time, and with no specialized equipment.},
