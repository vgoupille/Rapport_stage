## Division of Labor: A Fundamental Biological Principle

The survival of organisms in evolving environments is driven by their fitness[^01-introduction-1], where the cost-benefit ratio of traits is constantly balanced and gives rise to different populational evolutionary strategies. To succeed, organisms must compete, cooperate, and/or specialize based on how well their traits enable resource acquisition and utilization in their biotic and abiotic environment. Division of Labor (DoL) represents one such strategy for resource use optimisation. Division of labour occurs when different individuals, cells or tissues become specialised to perform complementary tasks that benefit the whole organism or social group [@taborsky2025] and improves collective performance [@cooper2018]. This fundamental principle operates throughout biological systems, from molecular evolution where gene duplication enables enzyme specialization, to multicellular organisms where cellular differentiation creates specialized tissues, to eusocial insect societies with their reproductive and functional caste systems [@giri2019].

[^01-introduction-1]: Fitness refers to the ability of an organism to survive and reproduce in its environment, measured by its reproductive success and contribution to future generations.

Among the diverse biological systems where DoL operates, microbial communities provide particularly compelling examples. Microbial communitie's dynamics demonstrate how DoL can emerge even among unicellular organisms, where individual cells can specialize in different metabolic functions while cooperating for collective benefit. Giri and colleagues have attempted to define the concept of DoL specifically within microbial communities, identifying key criteria that distinguish DoL from other types of ecological interactions [@giri2019]. Microbial interactions can be classified based on their directionality and the species involved. Interactions can be unidirectional or bidirectional, and can occur within the same species (intraspecific) or between different species (interspecific). For an interaction to qualify as DoL, it must involve reciprocal fitness benefits between partners, where both participants gain from the interaction. DoL between microbial species has been well-characterized in various ecosystems, with numerous examples of cross-feeding and mutualistic interactions documented in the human gut microbiome and soil communities [@rafieenia2022].

## Division of Labor in Root Microbiota

Building on this broader understanding of microbial DoL, the root microbiota represents a particularly well-studied example of interspecific DoL [@durán2018]. Roots of plants host diverse bacteria that are collectively referred to as the bacterial root microbiota. Unlike multicellular organisms that evolved diverse cell types to achieve distinct biological functions and promote a division of labour, unicellular organisms such as bacteria rely on limited metabolic specialisation possibilities as a unit. Indeed, recent reports [@mataigne2021; @mataigne2022], indicate that metabolic interdependencies and cross-feeding exchanges are widespread among taxonomically diverse bacteria and likely drive microbial co-existence within complex bacterial communities[@estrela2016; @adkins-jablonsky2021].

While interspecific DoL has been extensively studied [@giri2019], intraspecific DoL within clonal/isogenic[^01-introduction-2] bacterial populations remains less explored, despite its potential importance for understanding population-level adaptation and functional diversity. The traditional view of biological populations assumed that all individuals within a clonal population behave identically. However, evidence has accumulated over decades showing that even genetically identical organisms can exhibit functional heterogeneity, leading to population-level benefits through task specialization [@lópez-pagán2025].

[^01-introduction-2]: An isogenic population refers to a group of organisms that are genetically identical, derived from a single ancestral cell or clone.

A major unsolved question is whether populations of genetically identical bacteria can minimise energetically costly processes by each executing different metabolic tasks at the intra-population level. Here, we hypothesise that metabolic cooperation within bacterial populations plays a key role in modulating population dynamics, competitiveness, and persistence at the root–soil interface. This hypothesis builds on the idea that bacteria are subject to stochastic, noisy gene expression [@raj2008; @keren2015; @chowdhury2021]. In such systems, not all individuals respond identically to environmental cues, leading to phenotypic heterogeneity. This noise-driven diversity can be beneficial at the population level. The theory of Noise-Averaging Cooperation (NAC) [@lopez2022] further proposes that metabolic noise—exacerbated by the small size of bacteria—can constrain individual growth, but can be mitigated through metabolite sharing among related cells. This "leaky function", forming a "metabolic marketplace", allows populations to buffer stochastic fluctuations and improve collective fitness. In this context, cross-feeding interactions may emerge as a result of gene expression variability and/or the selection of advantageous mutations, fostering metabolic interdependencies within the population (see @fig-intraspecific-DoL).

Finally, environmental regulation also shapes this process: microenvironmental cues and spatial heterogeneity can induce context-dependent gene expression patterns [@lópez-pagán2025; @korshoj2024], which, if consistently beneficial, may become genetically encoded over evolutionary time. Altogether, these mechanisms point toward an intra-population division of labour emerging from the interplay between gene expression noise, environmental signals, and evolutionary selection.

*From the left to the right, co-metabolism within an isogenic bacterial population (A) and production of antimicrobials targeting other bacteria (B) can be considered as division of labour in a population. These mechanisms of division of labour can be based on differential transcription between bacteria (C) within a population and/or genetic variations between intra-populations (D).*

## *PsR401*: A Model System for Studying Intraspecific DoL

To investigate these theoretical frameworks of intraspecific DoL, we require a well-characterized bacterial model system that exhibits the complex metabolic interactions described above. The root environment provides an ideal context for studying such interactions, as successful bacterial establishment at roots requires the coordination of multiple independent biological processes. These include both host-microbe interactions (signal recognition, chemotaxis, surface attachment, biofilm formation, virulence factors) [@lópez-pagán2025] and microbe-microbe interactions (production of antimicrobials or public goods) [@knights2021]. Given the energetic costs associated with simultaneously activating these diverse processes, we postulate that cooperation between genetically identical strains is key for promoting bacterial pervasiveness at roots.

Consistent with this hypothesis, the robust root coloniser *Pseudomonas brassicacearum R401* (hereafter referred to as *PsR401*) provides an excellent model system for studying intraspecific DoL. This bacterium deploys multiple independent strategies that co-function to promote colonisation and persistence at roots [@getzke2023]. Unlike many pathogenic bacteria, *PsR401* lacks genes for a type III secretion system (T3SS) and does not overgrow or suppress plant immune responses [@jian2024; @dodds2024]. Instead, this opportunistic pathogen [@getzke2024] of the plant model *Arabidopsis thaliana* acts as a potent antagonist that relies on the combined action of three distinct exometabolites to suppress competitors and promote root colonization.

The three key exometabolites produced by *PsR401* each serve distinct but complementary functions. First, this Gram-negative bacterium produces Brassicapeptin [@getzke2024; @chesneau2025], a phytotoxin that promotes both pathogenicity and root colonization in mono-association experiments with *Arabidopsis thaliana*. Second, it synthesizes 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) [@getzke2023], an antimicrobial compound that directly inhibits competing microbes. Third, it produces pyoverdine [@getzke2023], a siderophore that chelates iron from the environment—an essential but scarce micronutrient in the rhizosphere [@cao2024].

The production of pyoverdine highlights the central role of iron availability in microbial interactions at the root–soil interface. Iron functions as a major micronutrient that modulates strain competitiveness and proliferation at roots [@gu2020; @harbort2020]. In iron-limited environments, siderophore-mediated iron scavenging confers a strong competitive advantage by depriving rival microbes of access to this vital resource. This resource competition, especially for iron, represents a key mechanism of indirect microbial antagonism. Beyond simply acquiring nutrients, microbes may also sequester them, preventing uptake by others and modulating community composition and function [@mesny2023].

## Biological Hypothesis

Given that iron functions as a public good whose availability becomes rate-limiting in the root compartment and that production of the above-mentioned processes are all modulated by iron availability,[@lim2012] we propose that division of labour (DoL) among genetically identical *PsR401* cells may be reinforced under iron-limiting conditions, such as those found in the root habitat. In such scenarios, phenotypic heterogeneity—whether driven by gene expression noise or environmentally induced regulation—could lead to subpopulations specialising in complementary tasks, such as toxin production, antimicrobial defense, or siderophore-mediated iron acquisition, thereby enhancing population-level fitness.

## Leveraging Single-Cell Transcriptomics to Study DoL

To test our biological hypothesis regarding intraspecific DoL in *PsR401*, we need to examine transcriptional heterogeneity at the single-cell level. Traditionally, studies of bacterial gene expression have relied on bulk RNA sequencing methods, which provide an average view of the transcriptome across a population.[@nishimura2025] However, these approaches mask the underlying cell-to-cell variability that is critical for understanding complex bacterial behaviors and adaptations. The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and now multi-omics technologies has provided unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity across various biological systems [@vandereyken2023; @nobori2025; @nobori]. Although eukaryotic cells have benefited from scRNA-seq technology since 2009, prokaryotic systems have faced significant implementation delays owing to distinct technical obstacles. These challenges include low RNA content in individual cells, the absence of poly-A tails on bacterial mRNAs, and diverse cell wall structures.[@nishimura2025] These factors necessitate the development of specialized techniques for efficient cell lysis, RNA extraction, and mRNA enrichment in bacterial systems. Despite these challenges, recent years have seen significant progress in developing and refining bacterial scRNA-seq methods [@nishimura2025; @sarfatis2025]. These methodological improvements have created novel opportunities to explore bacterial physiology, stress responses, and population dynamics at single-cell resolution.

## Research Objectives and Approach

### Our Focus: microSPLiT Technology

To address our biological hypothesis regarding intraspecific DoL in *PsR401*, we will leverage the microSPLiT (microbial Split-Pool Ligation Transcriptomics) technology [@kuchina2021; @gaisser2024]. This cutting-edge bacterial scRNA-seq method enables high-throughput profiling of individual bacterial cells, providing the resolution necessary to detect transcriptional heterogeneity within clonal populations. By analyzing *PsR401* cells under contrasting nutrient conditions—particularly iron-limited versus iron-replete environments—we hope to identify potential subpopulations that specialize in different metabolic tasks (see @fig-hypothesis-iron).

![Hypothesis of DoL in *PsR401* under iron-limiting conditions](../figures/DoL_hypothesis.png){#fig-hypothesis-iron width="80%" fig-align="center"}

*Testing the division of labor hypothesis in *PsR401* under two contrasting conditions: iron-limited and iron-replete environments. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with microSPLiT will enable detection of transcriptional heterogeneity within the population, revealing whether this specialization is driven by noisy gene expression or environmentally induced metabolic specialization.*

### Internship Goals and Expected Outcomes

Building upon the theoretical framework of intraspecific division of labor and the biological characteristics of *PsR401*, this internship aims to leverage cutting-edge single-cell transcriptomics to investigate metabolic cooperation within clonal bacterial populations. The primary goal is to validate the microSPLiT technology for bacterial systems while testing our hypothesis that iron limitation promotes functional specialization among genetically identical cells.

Through systematic analysis of transcriptional heterogeneity under contrasting iron conditions in culture medium, we expect to uncover whether *PsR401* populations exhibit distinct subpopulations with specialized metabolic functions or whether cooperation emerges through noisy gene expression regulation across the population. By examining temporal dynamics of gene expression patterns, we will gain insights into how these cooperative behaviors evolve and stabilize over time. This investigation will provide critical insights into the mechanisms underlying population-level adaptation and resilience, particularly in the context of fluctuating iron availability.

The expected outcomes of this research extend beyond understanding *PsR401* biology. Ultimately, this project will advance our understanding of how phenotypic diversity among clonal bacterial populations facilitates ecological success and resilience during root colonization, while establishing methodological foundations for future studies of bacterial population dynamics at single-cell resolution. By establishing robust methodologies for bacterial single-cell transcriptomics, this work will contribute to the broader field of microbial population dynamics.
