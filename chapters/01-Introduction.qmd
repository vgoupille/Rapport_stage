## Division of Labor: A Fundamental Biological Principle

The survival of organisms in evolving environments is driven by their fitness[^01-introduction-1], where the cost-benefit ratio of traits is constantly balanced and gives rise to different populational evolutionary strategies. To succeed, organisms must compete, cooperate, and/or specialize based on how well their traits enable resource acquisition and utilization in their biotic and abiotic environment. Division of Labor (DOL) represents one such strategy - the specialization of tasks of entities, optimizing resource use and enhancing collective performance [@cooper2018]. This fundamental principle operates throughout biological systems, from molecular evolution where gene duplication enables enzyme specialization, to multicellular organisms where cellular differentiation creates specialized tissues, to eusocial insect societies with their reproductive and functional caste systems [@giri2019]. Division of labour occurs when different individuals, cells or tissues become specialised to perform complementary tasks that benefit the whole organism or social group [@taborsky2025].

[^01-introduction-1]: Fitness refers to the ability of an organism to survive and reproduce in its environment, measured by its reproductive success and contribution to future generations.

## Division of Labor in Microbial Communities

Building upon these fundamental principles, microbial communities provide excellent examples of DOL in action. Giri and colleagues have attempted to define the concept of DOL specifically within microbial communities, identifying key criteria that distinguish true DOL from other types of ecological interactions [@giri2019]. Microbial interactions can be classified based on their directionality and the species involved (@fig-microbial-dol). Interactions can be unidirectional or bidirectional, and can occur within the same species (intraspecific) or between different species (interspecific). For an interaction to qualify as true DOL, it must involve reciprocal fitness benefits between partners, where both participants gain from the interaction. The figure below illustrates this distinction, showing how closed (reciprocal) interactions provide mutual fitness benefits, while open (linear) interactions represent parasitic or unidirectional relationships that do not qualify as DOL.

*Classification of pairwise and three-way interactions as DOL. Interactions can be uni- or bidirectional as well as occur within one or between two microbial species. Arrows indicate fitness benefits that are exchanged between interaction partners that can be direct (straight line) or indirect (dashed line). For an interaction to classify as DOL, four main criteria need to be fulfilled, which is only the case in closed (reciprocal) interactions (green), yet not in open (linear) interactions (red). (a) Mutually beneficial (reciprocal) interaction within two conspecific genotypes. (b) Mutually beneficial (reciprocal) interaction within two heterospecific genotypes. (c) Mutually beneficial (reciprocal) interaction between three different species. (d) Unidirectional interaction between two members of the same species. (e) Unidirectional interaction between three members of three different species. (f) Unidirectional interaction between two members of two different species. (g) Unidirectional (linear) interaction chain between members of three different species.*

## Interspecific Division of Labor in Root Microbiota

Interspecific DOL has been well-characterized in various ecosystems, with numerous examples of cross-feeding and mutualistic interactions documented in the human gut microbiome and soil communities [@rafieenia2022].

The root microbiota represents a particularly well-studied example of interspecific DOL. Roots of healthy plants host diverse bacteria that are collectively referred to as the bacterial root microbiota. Unlike their multicellular eukaryotic hosts that evolved diverse cell-types to achieve distinct biological functions and promote a division of labour, unicellular organisms such as bacteria rely on metabolic exchange(s) with their surrounding biotic environment to establish and maintain their ecological niches. Recent reports [@mataigne2021; @mataigne2022], indicate that metabolic interdependencies and cross-feeding exchanges are widespread among taxonomically diverse bacteria and likely drive microbial co-existence within complex bacterial communities[@estrela2016; @adkins-jablonsky2021]

The root environment presents unique challenges and opportunities for bacterial colonization. The rhizosphere, the soil region directly influenced by root exudates, represents a nutrient-rich but competitive environment where bacteria must balance resource acquisition with defense against competitors. This complex ecosystem provides an ideal setting for studying how bacterial populations adapt through functional specialization and metabolic cooperation.

## Intraspecific Division of Labor: An Emerging Research Area

While interspecific DOL has been extensively studied in various ecosystems, intraspecific DOL within clonal bacterial populations remains less explored, despite its potential importance for understanding population-level adaptation and functional diversity. The traditional view of biological populations assumed that all individuals within a clonal population behave identically. However, evidence has accumulated over decades showing that even genetically identical organisms can exhibit functional heterogeneity, leading to population-level benefits through task specialization [@lópez-pagán2025]. While intraspecific division of labor has been well-documented in multicellular organisms and social insects, its study in bacterial populations represents a more recent and growing field of research.

### Sources of Variation in Intraspecific DOL

Intraspecific DOL emerges through diverse mechanisms that create functional specialization within populations. These mechanisms can be broadly categorized into genetic and phenotypic sources of variation, though they often interact and overlap in complex ways that blur traditional boundaries between heritable and non-heritable traits.

Genetic mechanisms represent the most straightforward source of variation, where heritable mutations lead to gain or loss of function [@giri2019], or horizontal gene transfer introduces new capabilities[@cyriaque2024]. These changes create stable subpopulations with distinct functional profiles that persist across generations. Mutations in regulatory genes can create subpopulations with different metabolic preferences, allowing the population to exploit diverse resources simultaneously. A particularly striking example involves auxotrophic bacteria - organisms that have lost genes coding for essential molecules through mutations. These mutants can survive by relying on helper organisms that provide the missing compounds [@pande2014; @morris2012]. While this creates dependency, it also reduces metabolic costs and enables specialization within the population, allowing different mutants to thrive collectively in challenging environments.

However, genetic variation is not the only driver of functional specialization. Gene expression-based mechanisms involve more complex regulation of protein synthesis and can create transient or reversible[@dekkers1998] functional specialization that may eventually become genetically encoded. Random fluctuations in gene expression due to the inherent noise [@raj2008; @chowdhury2021; @keren2015] in biological systems can lead to phenotypic heterogeneity even among genetically identical cells. This noise-driven variation can create functional diversity that benefits the population as a whole. Building upon this concept, the novel theory of noise-averaging cooperation (NAC)[@lopez2022] explains how stochastic metabolic noise can drive the emergence of cross-feeding interactions and metabolic interdependencies. Due to their small size, bacteria experience substantial noise in metabolic regulation, which limits individual growth rates. To compensate, related bacteria can share metabolites to 'average out' this noise and improve collective growth. This metabolite sharing, or 'leakage', can then facilitate the evolution of metabolic interdependencies and even drive speciation through gene deletions, as predicted by the Black Queen Hypothesis [@morris2012]. The Black Queen Hypothesis, proposed by Morris and colleagues, suggests that in environments where certain functions are costly to maintain but beneficial to the community, some organisms may lose these functions (becoming "leaky") while others retain them, creating metabolic interdependencies. NAC thus provides a mechanistic link between stochastic gene expression noise and the emergence of genetic specialization within populations, bridging the gap between phenotypic and genetic mechanisms of variation.

Environmental regulation further complicates this picture, as differential gene expression driven by microenvironmental cues and cellular perception of local conditions [@korshoj2024] can create spatial or temporal patterns of functional specialization within populations. These environmentally-induced variations can become stabilized through genetic changes if they confer consistent fitness benefits, illustrating how phenotypic plasticity can drive evolutionary innovation.

These mechanisms often interact and overlap, making it challenging to distinguish between them. Factors such as growth/defense trade-offs, physiological state, growth stage, and even cell lysis can contribute to functional heterogeneity within populations. Importantly, phenotypic variation can provide the substrate for genetic evolution - stochastic gene expression patterns that confer fitness benefits may become stabilized through genetic changes over time. This evolutionary perspective highlights how the division of labor within populations can emerge through a complex interplay of immediate phenotypic responses and long-term genetic adaptation. The resolution of measurement techniques and the capacity to detect variation between cells (now possible with single-cell technologies) are crucial for understanding these complex interactions and their evolutionary implications.

## Model Organism: Pseudomonas brassicacearum R401



Successful establishment of bacteria at roots is driven by multiple independent biological processes
involved in both host-microbe (i.e., signal recognition, chemotaxis, surface attachment, biofilm
formation, virulence factors) and microbe-microbe interactions (i.e., production of antimicrobials or
public goods) (Knights et al. 2021). Therefore, we postulate that the simultaneous activation of these
diverse processes is costly and that cooperation between genetically identical strains is key for
promoting bacterial pervasiveness at roots. Consistent with this hypothesis, we recently
demonstrated that the robust root coloniser Pseudomonas brassicacearum R401 (hereafter referred
to as PsR401) deploys multiple independent strategies that co-function to promote colonisation and
persistence at roots (Getzke et al., 2023). Notably, we identified two independent processes involved
in microbe-microbe competition – namely the production of an antimicrobial and of a molecule
scavenging the micronutrient iron – that act additively to promote strain competitiveness at roots
(Getzke et al., 2023). We identified a third bacterial locus in PsR401 involved in the production of a
phytotoxin that promotes both pathogenicity and root colonisation in mono-association experiments
with A. thaliana (unpublished, see below). Our work provides proof-of-concept data illustrating that
PsR401 deploys diverse exo-metabolites during root microbiota establishment that have versatile
functions in host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions. Together with earlier work (Gu et al.
2020, Harbort et al 2020), it also delineates iron as a major micronutrient modulating strain
competitiveness and proliferation at roots. Given that the public good iron becomes rate-limiting in
the root compartment and that production of the above-mentioned processes are all modulated by
iron availability (Lim et al., 2012; Palma et al., 2003, Mo et al. 1991), we anticipate that division of
labour between bacterial intra-populations is bolstered under iron limiting conditions such as those
found in the root habitat.



Our study focuses on *Pseudomonas brassicacearum* R401 (PsR401), a robust root colonizer of *Arabidopsis thaliana* that can act as an opportunistic pathogen. This strain represents an excellent model for studying intraspecific DOL due to its complex colonization strategies and environmental adaptability.

### Colonization Strategies

PsR401 deploys multiple independent strategies for root colonization and persistence:

-   **Antimicrobial production**: Suppresses competitors in the rhizosphere
-   **Siderophore production**: Enhances iron acquisition and competitiveness by sequestering iron
-   **Phytotoxin production**: Promotes both pathogenicity and root colonization

### Iron as a Key Limiting Factor

These processes are all modulated by iron availability, which becomes rate-limiting in the root compartment. Iron acts as a "public good" in the rhizosphere - all bacteria require it, but it is scarce in the environment. Given that the production of antimicrobials, siderophores, and phytotoxines is energetically costly and iron-dependent, we hypothesize that division of labor between bacterial intra-populations is bolstered under iron-limiting conditions.

## Single-Cell Technologies: Unveiling Cellular Heterogeneity

Single-cell technologies have revolutionized our understanding of cellular diversity in eukaryotic systems. Methods such as scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, scMetabolomics, and spatial omics have provided unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity and functional specialization. These new technologies allow us to access within-species diversity and study the possible metabolic specialization between cells. Single-cell omics have been developed for this purpose in human health and are now applied to microbial systems. However, analyzing such datasets still requires custom pipelines to respond to the specificity of bacterial biology and technical challenges.

### Technical Challenges in Bacterial Single-Cell RNA-seq

However, applying these technologies to bacterial systems presents unique challenges:

-   **Lack of poly-A tails**: Bacterial mRNAs lack poly-A tails, requiring alternative capture methods
-   **High rRNA content**: rRNA constitutes up to 95% of bacterial RNA, necessitating effective depletion strategies
-   **Low RNA content**: Bacterial cells contain much less RNA than mammalian cells
-   **Cell wall complexity**: Diverse cell wall structures complicate RNA extraction
-   **Operon structure**: Bacterial operons require specific approaches for complete capture
-   **Small RNA detection**: Regulatory sRNAs are challenging to detect due to their short length

### Methodological Approaches

Several approaches have been developed to address these challenges:

-   **Plate-based methods**: High sensitivity but low throughput (hundreds of cells)
-   **Split-pool barcoding**: High throughput with moderate sensitivity (microSPLiT)
-   **Droplet-based methods**: Balance between throughput and sensitivity

## Research Objectives and Experimental Approach

### Primary Research Question

The goal of this internship is to explore scRNA-seq (single-cell RNA-seq) datasets of *Pseudomonas brassicacearum*, a root colonizer. The student will analyze sample datasets from various nutritional conditions to determine if DOL can be detected within this species as a strategy for efficient root colonization.

The central question of this study is: **Is there functional specialization (DOL) within clonal populations of PsR401?**

This question addresses two main biological hypotheses:

1.  **Noisy regulation hypothesis**: Gene expression varies stochastically between identical cells
2.  **Specialized cells hypothesis**: Certain cells become functionally specialized under specific conditions

### Experimental Design

We employ the microSPLiT technology [@kuchina2021], a high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing method for bacteria developed from SPLiT-seq for eukaryotic cells. This method allows for the analysis of transcriptomic heterogeneity within bacterial populations at single-cell resolution, providing insights into gene expression patterns and cellular diversity that would be masked in bulk RNA-seq approaches.

The experimental setup includes: - **Controlled conditions**: Iron-limiting and glucose-limiting environments - **Time course analysis**: During exponential growth phase - **Multiple replicates**: Biological and technical replicates for robust analysis - **High-throughput sequencing**: Targeting \~3,000 cells with \~1.5 billion reads

This approach will provide mechanistic insights into whether and how a robust bacterial root colonizer can partition tasks within intra-populations to achieve greater functional diversity, minimize energetic costs, and adapt to environmental constraints.

The ANR DivIDE project seeks to understand the mechanisms of division of labor in bacterial populations, with WP2 focusing on transcriptional variation supporting intraspecific DOL. This internship represents a first approach to exploring these complex interactions at the single-cell level.
