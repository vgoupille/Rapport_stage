## Trimming

ici j'ai suivi les recommendations de kuchina , seulement presenté les resultats Genfull  , mettre plus tard les resultats de Gene


-   renvoie vers l'annexe pour les multiqc (fastp, cutadapt) avant et apres trimming
-   
-   mais au final on obtient des resultats tres interessants et propres

=\> peut etre il aurait été interressant de faire un trimming comme kuchina 2021 pour comparer les resultats =\> renvoie vers la discussion pour le trimming fait dans l'article de [@kuchina2021] - avait presque 90% de saturation =\> a verifier si c'est vraiment le cas - et 10 % des sequences avec TSO (voir Annexe)

### Barcode Statistics Interpretation

The analysis of cell barcodes reveals several important points about our data quality:

- **Barcode Quality**: 
  - The absence of reads without adapter (`nNoAdapter = 0`) and without UMI (`nNoUMI = 0`) indicates excellent library preparation quality
  - The relatively low number of reads without cell barcode (`nNoCB = 67,177`) represents less than 0.01% of total reads, which is excellent

- **Barcode Accuracy**:
  - The majority of reads (1,046,121,284) have a perfectly aligned barcode (`nExactMatch`)
  - Approximately 53 million reads show a single mismatch (`nMismatchOneWL`)
  - The absence of reads with multiple matches (`nMismatchToMultWL = 0`) suggests good barcode specificity

- **UMI Quality**:
  - The number of invalid UMIs (`nNinUMI = 16,893,550`) represents a relatively small proportion of total reads and might be primarily due to sequencing errors at the beginning of reads, which is a common observation in Illumina sequencing
  - The presence of homopolymers in UMIs (`nUMIhomopolymer = 1,697,129`) is a known phenomenon that can affect molecular counting accuracy, but the relatively low number suggests this is not a major concern

- **Overall Matching**:
  - The significant number of unmatched reads (`nNoMatch = 163,166,830`) suggests that a substantial portion of reads do not match expected barcodes
  - This could be due to sequencing errors or potential contamination

These results indicate overall good library preparation quality, with excellent cell barcode specificity, although some improvements could be made regarding UMI quality.

### Detailed Interpretation of STARsolo Statistics

Based on the official STAR documentation and explanations from Alex Dobin (STAR developer) [@alexdobin/STAR#1887](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/issues/1887), here is a detailed interpretation of our STARsolo statistics:

#### Barcode Statistics (Barcodes.stats)
Statistics with the "no" prefix indicate reads that are not used for quantification:

- **Barcode Quality** :
  - `nNoAdapter` : Reads without adapter
  - `nNoUMI` : Reads without valid UMI
  - `nNoCB` : Reads without valid cell barcode
  - `nNinCB` : Reads with 'N' bases in cell barcode
  - `nNinUMI` : Reads with 'N' bases in UMI
  - `nUMIhomopolymer` : Reads with homopolymeric UMI

#### Mapping Statistics (Features.stats)
These statistics refer to the number of reads, except for `nCellBarcodes` and `nUMIs` which represent the number of valid cell barcodes and UMIs respectively.

- **General Mapping** :
  - `nUnmapped` : Reads not mapped to the genome
  - `nNoFeature` : Reads not mapped to an annotated feature
  - `nAmbigFeature` : Reads mapped to multiple features
  - `nAmbigFeatureMultimap` : Subset of `nAmbigFeature` where reads are mapped to multiple genomic loci

- **Mapping Quality** :
  - `nExactMatch` : Reads with exact mapping
  - `nMatch` : Total mapped reads (unique + multiple)
  - `nMatchUnique` : Reads with unique mapping

#### Sequencing Saturation
Sequencing saturation is calculated as follows:
```
Saturation = 1 - (N_umi / N_reads)
```
where:
- N_umi = number of unique CB/UMI/gene combinations
- N_reads = number of reads with valid CB/UMI/gene

In our case, the very low saturation (0.97%) indicates that we could sequence deeper to capture more unique molecules.

#### Key Points of Our Analysis
- The high number of ambiguous mappings (`nAmbigFeature = 936,951,032`) is typical for bacterial data due to the compact nature of the genome
- The majority of reads have exact mapping (`nExactMatch = 4,471,174,098`), indicating good mapping quality. This possibly includes both unique and multi-mapped reads that match exactly to their reference locations
- The number of detected cell barcodes (`nCellBarcodes = 699,355`) is high, suggesting good cellular diversity
- The number of UMIs (`nUMIs = 34,258,961`) indicates good molecular coverage

These metrics suggest that our data is of good technical quality, although the low saturation indicates potential for deeper sequencing.

## Interpretation of STARsolo Results

The STARsolo analysis revealed several key insights about our single-cell RNA-seq data:

### Sequencing Quality and Mapping

-   The sequencing quality is excellent, with over 95% of bases having Q30 quality scores in both barcode/UMI and RNA reads
-   A high proportion (85.58%) of reads contained valid cell barcodes, indicating good library preparation
-   The mapping rates are robust:
    -   89.57% of reads mapped to the genome (unique + multiple)
    -   75.64% of reads mapped to genes (unique + multiple)
-   The low unique mapping rate (3.64% to genome, 2.69% to genes) is typical for bacterial RNA-seq due to ...

### Mapping Terminology

-   **Gene mapping**: Refers to reads mapped to annotated coding sequences (CDS) only
-   **GeneFull mapping**: Includes reads mapped to all annotated features including:
    -   Coding sequences (CDS)
    -   Untranslated regions (UTRs)
    -   Non-coding RNAs
    -   Intergenic regions
    -   This broader mapping approach is particularly relevant for bacterial transcriptomics as it captures the full complexity of the transcriptome

### Cell Recovery and Expression

-   We estimated 27,203 cells in our dataset
-   The sequencing saturation is very low (0.97%), suggesting we could sequence deeper if needed
-   Cell-level metrics show good coverage:
    -   Mean/median reads per cell: 470/381
    -   Mean/median UMIs per cell: 465/378
    -   Mean/median genes per cell: 296/258
-   We detected 6,035 genes in total across all cells

### Data Quality Assessment

-   The high Q30 scores and mapping rates indicate good technical quality
-   The cell-level metrics suggest sufficient coverage for downstream analysis
-   The low sequencing saturation suggests potential for deeper sequencing if needed
-   The high proportion of reads with valid barcodes (85.58%) indicates good library preparation

Attention j'ai filtré pour ne garder que les CDS mais certains pas annotés 
plutot exclure les tRNA et rRNA 

In addition, we kept the highest-scored multimapping reads, assigning a fractional count based on the number of equally good alignments, because bacterial genomes are known to contain overlapping coding sequences. We then generated a matrix of gene counts for each cell (N-by-K matrix, with N cells and K genes).


dans l'article de kuchina ils ont filtré les cellules en fonction du nombre de reads et de genes :

“Processing of data from the heat shock experiment Clustering and data analysis for the speciesmixing experiment with heat shock treatment was performed using Scanpy (59). We only kept transcriptomes that had a **number of total reads higher than 200**. Then, we removed the **ribosomal and tRNA reads from the data**, retaining only reads that represented the mRNA counts for both species. We further filtered cells based on the mRNA counts, **retaining cells expressing >100 reads and >100 genes**, and additionally filtered the genes, retaining the **genes expressed in >5 cells**. We then applied standard Scanpy normalization and scaling, dimensionality reduction, and clustering, as described in the Scanpy tutorial (59, 60). The clusters were produced by the Louvain graph-clustering method and manually inspected for the top differentially expressed genes. After inspection, three pairs of transcriptionally similar clusters with fewer differentially expressed genes were merged, resulting in clusters 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 1D.” ([Kuchina et al., 2021, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/AWDKBVJW)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YFM8QJY6?page=9&annotation=LXF2XHIY))

le choix de filtration sera discuté apres

because the reads depth is different between : Stress condition (M9F) and non-stress condition (M9) et also between the 3 timepoints (T1, T2, T3) (voir figure, reuslttas comme deja observé chez )




Single-cell analysis Two separate libraries were concatenated after filtering, log-normalized by 600 counts per cell, and scaled to unit variance and zero mean. Subsequently, ComBat(70) was run for batch effect correction. Normalized expression data was dimensionally reduced using principal component analysis (PCA). Shared neighbor graphs and uniform manifold approximation representations (UMAP(71)) were calculated with the first 12 principal components. All subsequent calculations were run in Python using Scanpy(72) documentation for single-cell analysis. Differential gene expression analysis Scanpy gene ranking functions (sc.tl.rank_genes_groups and sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df) were used to analyze and retrieve statistical data between two groups of interest within the annotated data object. The output parameters included names of all genes, z-score, log fold change, p-values, and adjusted p-values. To create a volcano plot from this data, either the |score| or -log(adjusted p-value) was plotted on the y-axis against the log-fold change on the x axis. Lists of defense genes from DefenseFinder(39), host response genes upregulated after phage treatment, and CPS genes were used to assign colors to each point. Host response genes were taken as the top 15 distinct genes identified in the phage-treated sample only clustering analysis relative to the untreated sample. Initial CPS gene annotations were mapped by and received from Dr. Laurie Comstock (University of Chicago). Calculation of co-expression scores To assess the co-expression between two genes A and B, first, probabilities of expression of individual genes were calculated as fractions of cells having above-zero normalized non-scaled expression values p(A) and p(B), respectively. Then, the probability of simultaneous expression of the two genes, p(A&B), was calculated as a fraction of cells having above-zero normalized non-scaled expression values for both inspected genes. Co-expression score was calculated as a ratio of p(A&B) to the multiplication of p(A) and p(B). Values close to 1 indicate independent expression of genes; values above 1 indicate co-expression, and values below 1 indicate mutually exclusive expression of genes. To define a border of a CPS operon, mean co-expression values were calculated between genes adjacent to the CPS operon and core genes of a CPS operon. Co-expression between gene sets (e.g., CPS operons) was calculated similarly to genes, with probability of expression calculated as a fraction of cells having above-zero normalized non-scaled expression values for any of genes within a set. Diffusion pseudotime analysis The data was first subsetted into the phage-treated sample alone. A root cell was defined using adata.uns[‘iroot’] = np.flatnonzero(adata.obs[‘louvan’]==0)[1], which selected a random indexed cell from the untreated cluster within all phage-treated cells. Scanpy diffusion maps were created prior to running the existing diffusion pseudotime tool with 0 branchings and 10 diffusion components. For downstream analysis using pseudotime values, 5 bins of equal size were created to group cells into pseudotime ranges (0.0-0.2, 0.2-0.4, 0.4-0.6, 0.6-0.8, and 0.8-1.0). Differential expression analysis was run to identify the top 10 distinct B. fragilis genes within each pseudotime bin, and the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) database was used to define functional categories for these genes. Duplicate genes were removed. Raw mean expression for each of these genes, grouped by functional category, was calculated using the adata.raw.X matrix.

#### General analytical approach

The analysis workflow encompassed several key steps: Normalization and scaling, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and differential expression analysis. We systematically tested different parameters and methodologies to optimize each step of the pipeline. We followed the [Scanpy tutorial](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/basics/clustering.html) for the general approach. 

**Normalization and scaling.** Expression data was log-normalized using `sc.pp.normalize_total` followed by log transformation using `sc.pp.log1p`, and scaled to unit variance and zero mean using `sc.pp.scale`. We tested different normalization factors (i.e. 1000, 2000, and 10000 counts per cell) to determine the optimal normalization strategy for our bacterial single-cell data.

**Features (genes) selection and dimensionality reduction.** We evaluated different feature selection approaches. First, we tested strategies to filter genes by condition, retaining only genes that are detected in a certain percentage of cells within each experimental condition. Genes not meeting this threshold were eliminated from the analysis. Additionally, we implemented the classical Scanpy approach using variance-based selection with `sc.pp.highly_variable_genes` for highly variable gene identification. The distribution of variable features was visualized using `sc.pl.highly_variable_genes` to assess the selection quality. Tests were conducted both with and without feature selection to assess its impact on downstream analysis. When feature selection was applied, scaling to unit variance and zero mean was performed after the selection step using `sc.pp.scale`.

**Principal component analysis (PCA).** PCA was computed using `sc.pp.pca`, with the number of principal components systematically tested at multiple levels (i.e. 3, 10, 20, 50) depending on the data characteristics. The optimal number of components was determined using Scanpy's `sc.pl.pca_variance_ratio` plot, which displays the explained variance ratio for each principal component, allowing us to identify the elbow point where additional components provide diminishing returns in variance explanation.

**Clustering and visualization.** We computed shared nearest neighbor graphs using `sc.pp.neighbors` and tested multiple clustering algorithms including Leiden clustering (`sc.tl.leiden`) with different resolution parameters (i.e. 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0) to identify the optimal clustering granularity. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was computed using `sc.tl.umap` for visualization, with parameters optimized for bacterial single-cell data. For comparison and validation purposes, we also performed the same analytical workflow using Seurat v5, which yielded similar results and performance, confirming the robustness of our analytical approach across different computational frameworks.


**Differential expression analysis**

Differential gene expression analysis was performed using Scanpy's gene ranking functions (`sc.tl.rank_genes_groups` and `sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df`) to compare expression patterns between experimental conditions. Statistical outputs included gene names, z-scores, log fold changes, p-values, and adjusted p-values for robust identification of differentially expressed genes. 

#### Test of BacSC protocol

To systematically identify optimal parameters for bacterial single-cell analysis, we also implemented and tested the BacSC protocol (currently a preprint @ostner), a fully data-driven computational pipeline that processes bacterial single-cell data without requiring manual intervention. This automated pipeline performs data-adaptive quality control and variance stabilization, selects suitable parameters for dimension reduction, neighborhood embedding, and clustering, and provides false discovery rate control in differential gene expression testing. The protocol systematically evaluates different normalization factors, feature selection thresholds, clustering resolutions, and dimensionality reduction parameters to find the configuration that best captures biological variation while minimizing technical artifacts.


### Analytical scope and limitations

This study represents an initial exploratory phase of single-cell RNA-seq analysis. While we established a comprehensive data processing pipeline, several advanced analytical approaches were not pursued due to the exploratory nature of our investigation. These include pseudobulk analysis, trajectory inference, gene co-expression networks, and gene ontology enrichment.

The results presented in the following section focus on fundamental aspects: data quality assessment, basic clustering and visualization, and initial differential expression analysis between culture conditions. This approach establishes the validity of our experimental design and analytical pipeline while providing insights into the transcriptional responses of *P. brassicacearum* R401 to different nutrient availability conditions. The exploratory nature of bacterial single-cell RNA-seq data and time constraints limited our ability to pursue more advanced analytical approaches at this stage.
