An isogenic population of *P. brassicacearum* PR401 was initially cultured on petri dishes and then transferred to different liquid media to investigate the effects of nutrient availability on bacterial growth and gene expression (@fig-experimental-design).

Two distinct culture conditions were applied to the bacteria: M9 medium containing low glucose and low iron concentrations, and M9F medium containing high glucose and high iron concentrations (see @tbl-media for detailed concentrations). Each condition was replicated three times to ensure statistical robustness of the experimental results. The bacterial growth was monitored by measuring optical density (OD) at regular intervals. The growth curves obtained from these measurements are presented (@fig-growth-curves) and (@tbl-growth-curves). This experimental design resulted in a total of 18 conditions: 2 media types × 3 biological replicates × 3 time points, providing comprehensive coverage of the growth dynamics under different nutrient conditions.

Growth curves for each condition showing the optical density (OD) measurements over time for M9 and M9F media across three biological replicates (Rep A, B, C) at three time points (T1, T2, T3).

The growth curves reveal distinct patterns between the two culture conditions. Bacteria grown in M9F medium (high glucose and iron) exhibited significantly higher growth rates and reached higher optical densities (OD 0.17-0.21 at T1, 0.59-0.63 at T2, 0.74-0.83 at T3) compared to M9 medium (low glucose and iron) which showed limited growth (OD 0.13 at T1, 0.28-0.33 at T2, 0.26 at T3). While M9F cultures showed continued growth from T2 to T3, the growth rate slowed down during this period, indicating the beginning of transition towards stationary phase. The M9 cultures appeared to reach a growth plateau by T3, while M9F cultures maintained higher densities despite the growth deceleration, suggesting nutrient limitation in the M9 condition. Biological replicates showed excellent reproducibility validating the experimental design. 

Cells were collected at each timepoint (T1, T2, T3) from all biological replicates for subsequent single-cell RNA-seq analysis using the microSPLiT protocol.

## microSPLiT protocol

The microSPLiT (microbial Split-Pool Ligation Transcriptomics) protocol enables single-cell RNA sequencing of bacteria by performing barcoding reactions inside individual cells rather than in separate reaction vessels . This approach maintains single-cell resolution throughout the entire process, from cell fixation to library preparation. The protocol involves multiple rounds of split-pool barcoding where cells are distributed into 96-well plates, barcoded, pooled, and redistributed for subsequent rounds, creating unique barcode combinations that identify individual cells. This method allows for the analysis of transcriptomic heterogeneity within bacterial populations at single-cell resolution, providing insights into gene expression patterns and cellular diversity that would be masked in bulk RNA-seq approaches.
