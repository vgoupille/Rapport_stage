# Results


This chapter presents the findings of our single-cell RNA-seq analysis of *P. brassicacearum* R401, focusing on the division of labor within bacterial populations. To investigate division of labor patterns, we first established robust data quality through comprehensive preprocessing and quality control steps. We then applied appropriate filtering strategies to ensure reliable cell identification and gene expression quantification. These preliminary steps are essential prerequisites that will enable us to characterize the cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional diversity across different experimental conditions to identify potential division of labor mechanisms.

Artifacts content of the sublibrary BC_0076 before and after trimming with Cutadapt and Fastp
:::

*The adapter content analysis shows the presence of various sequencing artifacts in the raw data (example of BC_0076). In the before trimming plot (@fig-before), distinct patterns are visible: polyG stretches (pink), polyA tails (cyan), and Illumina adapter sequences (purple). After trimming (@fig-after), these artifacts are effectively removed, resulting in clean sequence data suitable for downstream analysis. The successful elimination of these technical artifacts demonstrates the effectiveness of the trimming pipeline in improving data quality.*

The trimming process successfully removed various sequencing artifacts and improved data quality for downstream analysis. The preprocessing pipeline eliminated template-switching oligo (TSO) sequences, polyG stretches (NovaSeq-specific artifacts), polyA tails, and adapter sequences from the raw sequencing data (@fig-adaptateur, @tbl-summary-trimming). This cleaning step was essential for accurate gene expression quantification and reliable single-cell analysis.

#### Trimming Efficiency and Data Retention

The trimming process resulted in an average reduction of 25.4% in the total number of sequences across all sublibraries, from 1,733.7 million to 1,284.5 million reads (@tbl-summary-trimming). This reduction rate is within the expected range for single-cell RNA-seq data and indicates effective removal of low-quality sequences while preserving the majority of informative reads. The final dataset of 1.284 billion reads provides substantial sequencing depth for robust analysis.

#### Sub-library Size Variations and Their Implications

The four sublibraries showed notable size differences before trimming, ranging from 325.5 million reads (BC_0077) to 631.4 million reads (BC_0076) (@tbl-summary-trimming). These variations likely reflect differences in library preparation efficiency and sequencing performance across the flowcell. The largest library (BC_0076) exhibited the most significant reduction in read length after trimming (from 241bp to 127bp), suggesting higher levels of sequencing artifacts in this sublibrary (@tbl-summary-trimming).

#### Quality Improvements and Technical Considerations

The trimming process revealed interesting patterns across sublibraries. BC_0076 and BC_0080 showed the most pronounced reductions in R1 read length, which may indicate higher initial quality of these libraries requiring more aggressive trimming to remove artifacts while maintaining better overall data integrity.

BC_0076 specifically showed earlier and more prominent polyG artifacts, likely due to reagent depletion during sequencing that led to increased G nucleotide incorporation errors. This phenomenon is common in NovaSeq sequencing runs where the largest libraries may experience reagent exhaustion, resulting in higher error rates and more artifacts that require removal during trimming. Despite these technical challenges, the trimming process successfully mitigated these artifacts, resulting in high-quality data suitable for downstream analysis.

## Recommendations for Future Experiments

The observed size variations between sublibraries highlight the importance of balanced library preparation for optimal sequencing efficiency. Libraries of unequal sizes can lead to differential reagent consumption and varying quality across the flowcell. Future experiments should aim for more balanced library sizes to minimize technical artifacts and ensure consistent quality across all sublibraries.

### Transcriptome Description after STARsolo processing

Following the successful preprocessing and trimming of our sequencing data, we performed alignment against the reference genome of *P. brassicacearum R401* (@fig-genome). The barcode reading and quantification by STARsolo provided comprehensive quality metrics and mapping statistics.

: Summary of metrics obtained with STARsolo after barcode-UMI reading and alignment with the reference genome of *P. brassicacearum R401* {#tbl-starsolo-comprehensive layout-ncol="1"}

*Metrics obtained with STARsolo after barcode-UMI reading and alignment with the reference genome of *P. brassicacearum R401*.*

The STARsolo analysis processed the 1.284 billion trimmed reads and successfully identified 1.099 billion reads with valid barcodes (85.58% of total reads), demonstrating excellent barcode quality (@tbl-starsolo-comprehensive). Among these, 81.44% had exact barcode matches and 4.14% had single mismatches, indicating robust cell identification. The sequencing quality was outstanding with Q30 scores above 95% for both RNA reads and barcode/UMI sequences. This high percentage of valid barcodes falls within the expected range of 70-90% for successful experiments, as recommended by Gaisser et al. (2024) (@gaisser2024), indicating excellent library preparation and barcoding efficiency with no significant issues in the protocol optimization.

Gene mapping analysis revealed that 75.64% of reads mapped to genes, with 2.69% showing unique mapping and the remainder showing multiple mapping, which is typical for bacterial genomes with overlapping genes and repeated sequences. The fraction of uniquely aligned reads (2.69%) falls within the expected range of 3-12% for bacterial samples (Gaisser et al. (@gaisser2024)). This value is influenced by the species-specific characteristics and experimental conditions.

A total of 6,035 genes were detected across 699,355 unique cell barcodes, representing 96.6% of the 6,249 genes (@fig-genome) annotated in the *P. brassicacearum R401* genome, with one gene being automatically ignored by STARsolo due to poor annotation.

The sequencing saturation, calculated as:

$$ Sequencing\ Saturation = 1 - \frac{N_{\text{umi}}}{N_{\text{reads with valid barcodes}}} = 1 - \frac{36,565,214}{1,099,327,755} = 0.97\% $$

  - Where:
    - $N_{\text{umi}}$ = number of unique molecules detected, distinct combinations of Cell Barcode (CB) / UMI / gene
    - $N_{\text{reads}}$ = total number of reads with valid CB/UMI/gene combinations
  

::: {.callout-warning}
This very low saturation indicates that we have captured only a small fraction of the total unique molecules in the transcriptome. According to Gaisser et al. (2024) @gaisser2024, a sequencing saturation of <0.5 may indicate that more sequencing is required to capture all barcoded transcripts in the library, with a saturation value of ≥0.7 typically indicating sufficient coverage. Our saturation value of 0.97% falls well below these recommended thresholds, suggesting that **our current sequencing depth may not be sufficient to capture the full complexity of the transcriptome**. While the current sequencing depth of 1.284 billion reads provides substantial coverage, the low saturation indicates that we could potentially benefit from deeper sequencing to capture more unique transcripts and achieve better coverage of the transcriptional landscape.

Compositional analysis of *P. brassicacearum* R401 genome annotation and transcriptome distribution of different RNA types
:::

The genome and transcriptome composition analysis reveals the distribution of different RNA types in our *P. brassicacearum* sample. In the [annotated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/gene/GCA_030064105.1/)  genome of *P. brassicacearum* R401, we identified 6,100 mRNA genes (97.6% of total genes), 65 tRNA genes, 16 rRNA genes (0.3% of the genome) and 68 other genes. However, in the transcriptome analysis of our 36,565,214 UMIs, the distribution shows a different pattern: 57.1% correspond to mRNA transcripts (21 millions), while 28.4% are rRNA transcripts (representing approximately 10 millions UMIs), 10.2 % are tRNA transcripts (representing approximately 4 millions UMIs) and 4.4% are other genes (representing approximately 1.5 millions UMIs). This distribution concords with the well-established observation that rRNA and tRNA transcripts represent a large proportion of the bacterial transcriptome despite constituting only a small fraction of the genome, due to their high transcriptional activity and stability @nishimura2025.



Before filtering, our dataset contained 699,355 unique cell barcodes, which is consistent with the expected large number of barcode combinations (>800,000) that typically contain only a small number of transcripts. These likely represent trace amounts of barcode contamination present throughout the protocol, including potentially within the source oligonucleotide plates. These contaminating barcodes can be effectively filtered using barcode-rank or knee plot analysis, which we applied in our filtering strategy.


### Cell Filtering Strategy

For our division of labor analysis, we retained all cell barcodes that passed quality control (820,800 barcodes), rather than applying additional filtering thresholds. This approach maximizes our ability to detect rare subpopulations and subtle division of labor patterns that might be missed with more stringent filtering.

**Important Note on STARsolo Default Filtering:**
We deliberately did not use STARsolo's default filtering method (KneePant), which would have resulted in approximately 27,000 cells. This decision was based on the concern that the KneePant method might eliminate stressed cells that could have lower quality metrics compared to non-stressed cells, potentially biasing our division of labor analysis by removing biologically relevant subpopulations.

The choice of filtering strategy is complex and context-dependent. As mentioned in the literature, various filtering approaches exist:
- Filtering based on read types (global or condition-specific thresholds)
- Filtering based on reads per cell
- Filtering based on genes expressed per cell
- Filtering based on reads per gene

In the Kuchina et al. (2021) study, they used a threshold of 200 UMI per cell, but we chose a more inclusive approach to capture the full spectrum of cellular heterogeneity in our *P. brassicacearum* population.

Filtering of cells with less than 100 UMI per cell
:::

The filtering analysis shows the distribution of UMI counts per cell before and after applying quality thresholds. This visualization helps assess the impact of filtering on our ability to detect division of labor patterns and ensures we maintain sufficient statistical power for downstream analysis.

**Key considerations for division of labor analysis:**
- The choice of filtering threshold can significantly impact the detection of rare subpopulations
- Housekeeping genes and rRNA content may provide insights into growth rate variations across cells
- Technical replicates may need to be pooled or analyzed separately depending on experimental design






### Cell Recovery and Expression Profiling

Our analysis successfully captured a substantial population of bacterial cells with good coverage:

In addition, we kept the highest-scored multimapping reads, assigning a fractional count based on the number of equally good alignments, because bacterial genomes are known to contain overlapping coding sequences. We then generated a matrix of gene counts for each cell (N-by-K matrix, with N cells and K genes).

The low saturation may be partially explained by the high complexity of the bacterial transcriptome and the large number of unique cell barcode combinations detected (699,355).









Our results align well with the expected performance metrics for single-cell RNA-seq in bacteria.


It is important to note that preliminary STARsolo tests without trimming yielded saturation values 0.94 **> 0.7**, which would have met the Gaisser et al. (@gaisser2024) recommendation for adequate sequencing depth. However, these elevated saturation values were not due to superior sequencing quality but rather to less effectively trimmed reads that artificially affected the saturation ratio. The lower saturation observed in our final analysis with proper trimming (0.0097) actually reflects more accurate data quality assessment, as the trimming process removed sequencing artifacts and low-quality reads that would have otherwise inflated the saturation metric. This observation suggests that the interpretation of saturation values in the Gaisser et al.(@gaisser2024) study may need revision, as their trimming protocol reportedly left approximately 10% of TSO sequences remaining, which could have artificially inflated their saturation metrics. While our saturation value of 0.97% falls well below their recommended threshold of >0.7, this difference likely reflects the superior quality of our trimming protocol rather than inadequate sequencing depth. The low saturation value (0.97%) indicates minimal redundancy in our sequencing data, suggesting that a substantial portion of the transcriptome remains unexplored. This implies that deeper sequencing could potentially capture additional unique transcripts and provide more comprehensive coverage of the transcriptional landscape.

For our division of labor analysis focusing on mRNA expression patterns, these highly abundant non-coding RNAs will need to be filtered out to avoid masking subtle transcriptional differences between subpopulations. This information is crucial for understanding the transcriptional landscape and identifying potential division of labor patterns, as different RNA types may be differentially expressed across subpopulations.
