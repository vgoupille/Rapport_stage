# Results

- 4 libraries of unequal sizes (see Solène's explanation for why they were not exactly equivalent)
- This impacts library efficiency 
- => Recommendation: balance the libraries for optimal results




## Stats sur les reads R1 et R2 : 
- On a subset of 1,000,000 reads:
  - Percentage of reads containing TSO
  - Percentage of reads containing polyA
  - Percentage of reads containing adapter
  - Percentage of reads containing linker
  -> possibly in appendix


Reminder about saturation calculation method:






## Trimming

ici j'ai suivi les recommendations de kuchina , seulement presenté les resultats Genfull  , mettre plus tard les resultats de Gene


-   renvoie vers l'annexe pour les multiqc (fastp, cutadapt) avant et apres trimming
-   
-   mais au final on obtient des resultats tres interessants et propres

=\> peut etre il aurait été interressant de faire un trimming comme kuchina 2021 pour comparer les resultats =\> renvoie vers la discussion pour le trimming fait dans l'article de [@kuchina2021] - avait presque 90% de saturation =\> a verifier si c'est vraiment le cas - et 10 % des sequences avec TSO (voir Annexe)

### Barcode Statistics Interpretation

The analysis of cell barcodes reveals several important points about our data quality:

- **Barcode Quality**: 
  - The absence of reads without adapter (`nNoAdapter = 0`) and without UMI (`nNoUMI = 0`) indicates excellent library preparation quality
  - The relatively low number of reads without cell barcode (`nNoCB = 67,177`) represents less than 0.01% of total reads, which is excellent

- **Barcode Accuracy**:
  - The majority of reads (1,046,121,284) have a perfectly aligned barcode (`nExactMatch`)
  - Approximately 53 million reads show a single mismatch (`nMismatchOneWL`)
  - The absence of reads with multiple matches (`nMismatchToMultWL = 0`) suggests good barcode specificity

- **UMI Quality**:
  - The number of invalid UMIs (`nNinUMI = 16,893,550`) represents a relatively small proportion of total reads and might be primarily due to sequencing errors at the beginning of reads, which is a common observation in Illumina sequencing
  - The presence of homopolymers in UMIs (`nUMIhomopolymer = 1,697,129`) is a known phenomenon that can affect molecular counting accuracy, but the relatively low number suggests this is not a major concern

- **Overall Matching**:
  - The significant number of unmatched reads (`nNoMatch = 163,166,830`) suggests that a substantial portion of reads do not match expected barcodes
  - This could be due to sequencing errors or potential contamination

These results indicate overall good library preparation quality, with excellent cell barcode specificity, although some improvements could be made regarding UMI quality.

### Detailed Interpretation of STARsolo Statistics

Based on the official STAR documentation and explanations from Alex Dobin (STAR developer) [@alexdobin/STAR#1887](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/issues/1887), here is a detailed interpretation of our STARsolo statistics:

#### Barcode Statistics (Barcodes.stats)
Statistics with the "no" prefix indicate reads that are not used for quantification:

- **Barcode Quality** :
  - `nNoAdapter` : Reads without adapter
  - `nNoUMI` : Reads without valid UMI
  - `nNoCB` : Reads without valid cell barcode
  - `nNinCB` : Reads with 'N' bases in cell barcode
  - `nNinUMI` : Reads with 'N' bases in UMI
  - `nUMIhomopolymer` : Reads with homopolymeric UMI

#### Mapping Statistics (Features.stats)
These statistics refer to the number of reads, except for `nCellBarcodes` and `nUMIs` which represent the number of valid cell barcodes and UMIs respectively.

- **General Mapping** :
  - `nUnmapped` : Reads not mapped to the genome
  - `nNoFeature` : Reads not mapped to an annotated feature
  - `nAmbigFeature` : Reads mapped to multiple features
  - `nAmbigFeatureMultimap` : Subset of `nAmbigFeature` where reads are mapped to multiple genomic loci

- **Mapping Quality** :
  - `nExactMatch` : Reads with exact mapping
  - `nMatch` : Total mapped reads (unique + multiple)
  - `nMatchUnique` : Reads with unique mapping

#### Sequencing Saturation
Sequencing saturation is calculated as follows:
```
Saturation = 1 - (N_umi / N_reads)
```
where:
- N_umi = number of unique CB/UMI/gene combinations
- N_reads = number of reads with valid CB/UMI/gene

In our case, the very low saturation (0.97%) indicates that we could sequence deeper to capture more unique molecules.

#### Key Points of Our Analysis
- The high number of ambiguous mappings (`nAmbigFeature = 936,951,032`) is typical for bacterial data due to the compact nature of the genome
- The majority of reads have exact mapping (`nExactMatch = 4,471,174,098`), indicating good mapping quality. This possibly includes both unique and multi-mapped reads that match exactly to their reference locations
- The number of detected cell barcodes (`nCellBarcodes = 699,355`) is high, suggesting good cellular diversity
- The number of UMIs (`nUMIs = 34,258,961`) indicates good molecular coverage

These metrics suggest that our data is of good technical quality, although the low saturation indicates potential for deeper sequencing.

## Interpretation of STARsolo Results

The STARsolo analysis revealed several key insights about our single-cell RNA-seq data:

### Sequencing Quality and Mapping

-   The sequencing quality is excellent, with over 95% of bases having Q30 quality scores in both barcode/UMI and RNA reads
-   A high proportion (85.58%) of reads contained valid cell barcodes, indicating good library preparation
-   The mapping rates are robust:
    -   89.57% of reads mapped to the genome (unique + multiple)
    -   75.64% of reads mapped to genes (unique + multiple)
-   The low unique mapping rate (3.64% to genome, 2.69% to genes) is typical for bacterial RNA-seq due to ...

### Mapping Terminology

-   **Gene mapping**: Refers to reads mapped to annotated coding sequences (CDS) only
-   **GeneFull mapping**: Includes reads mapped to all annotated features including:
    -   Coding sequences (CDS)
    -   Untranslated regions (UTRs)
    -   Non-coding RNAs
    -   Intergenic regions
    -   This broader mapping approach is particularly relevant for bacterial transcriptomics as it captures the full complexity of the transcriptome

### Cell Recovery and Expression

-   We estimated 27,203 cells in our dataset
-   The sequencing saturation is very low (0.97%), suggesting we could sequence deeper if needed
-   Cell-level metrics show good coverage:
    -   Mean/median reads per cell: 470/381
    -   Mean/median UMIs per cell: 465/378
    -   Mean/median genes per cell: 296/258
-   We detected 6,035 genes in total across all cells

### Data Quality Assessment

-   The high Q30 scores and mapping rates indicate good technical quality
-   The cell-level metrics suggest sufficient coverage for downstream analysis
-   The low sequencing saturation suggests potential for deeper sequencing if needed
-   The high proportion of reads with valid barcodes (85.58%) indicates good library preparation

Attention j'ai filtré pour ne garder que les CDS mais certains pas annotés 
plutot exclure les tRNA et rRNA 

In addition, we kept the highest-scored multimapping reads, assigning a fractional count based on the number of equally good alignments, because bacterial genomes are known to contain overlapping coding sequences. We then generated a matrix of gene counts for each cell (N-by-K matrix, with N cells and K genes).


dans l'article de kuchina ils ont filtré les cellules en fonction du nombre de reads et de genes :

“Processing of data from the heat shock experiment Clustering and data analysis for the speciesmixing experiment with heat shock treatment was performed using Scanpy (59). We only kept transcriptomes that had a **number of total reads higher than 200**. Then, we removed the **ribosomal and tRNA reads from the data**, retaining only reads that represented the mRNA counts for both species. We further filtered cells based on the mRNA counts, **retaining cells expressing >100 reads and >100 genes**, and additionally filtered the genes, retaining the **genes expressed in >5 cells**. We then applied standard Scanpy normalization and scaling, dimensionality reduction, and clustering, as described in the Scanpy tutorial (59, 60). The clusters were produced by the Louvain graph-clustering method and manually inspected for the top differentially expressed genes. After inspection, three pairs of transcriptionally similar clusters with fewer differentially expressed genes were merged, resulting in clusters 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 1D.” ([Kuchina et al., 2021, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/AWDKBVJW)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YFM8QJY6?page=9&annotation=LXF2XHIY))
