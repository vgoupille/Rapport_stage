# Results


This chapter presents the findings of our single-cell RNA-seq analysis of *P. brassicacearum* R401, focusing on the division of labor within bacterial populations. To investigate division of labor patterns, we first established robust data quality through comprehensive preprocessing and quality control steps. We then applied appropriate filtering strategies to ensure reliable cell identification and gene expression quantification. These preliminary steps are essential prerequisites that will enable us to characterize the cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional diversity across different experimental conditions to identify potential division of labor mechanisms.

Artifacts content of the sublibrary BC_0076 before and after trimming with Cutadapt and Fastp
:::

*The adapter content analysis shows the presence of various sequencing artifacts in the raw data (example of BC_0076). In the before trimming plot (@fig-before), distinct patterns are visible: polyG stretches (pink), polyA tails (cyan), and Illumina adapter sequences (purple). After trimming (@fig-after), these artifacts are effectively removed, resulting in clean sequence data suitable for downstream analysis. The successful elimination of these technical artifacts demonstrates the effectiveness of the trimming pipeline in improving data quality.*

The trimming process successfully removed various sequencing artifacts and improved data quality for downstream analysis. The preprocessing pipeline eliminated template-switching oligo (TSO) sequences, polyG stretches (NovaSeq-specific artifacts), polyA tails, and adapter sequences from the raw sequencing data (@fig-adaptateur, @tbl-summary-trimming). This cleaning step was essential for accurate gene expression quantification and reliable single-cell analysis.

#### Trimming Efficiency and Data Retention

The trimming process resulted in an average reduction of 25.4% in the total number of sequences across all sublibraries, from 1,733.7 million to 1,284.5 million reads (@tbl-summary-trimming). This reduction rate is within the expected range for single-cell RNA-seq data and indicates effective removal of low-quality sequences while preserving the majority of informative reads. The final dataset of 1.284 billion reads provides substantial sequencing depth for robust analysis.

#### Sub-library Size Variations and Their Implications

The four sublibraries showed notable size differences before trimming, ranging from 325.5 million reads (BC_0077) to 631.4 million reads (BC_0076) (@tbl-summary-trimming). These variations likely reflect differences in library preparation efficiency and sequencing performance across the flowcell. The largest library (BC_0076) exhibited the most significant reduction in read length after trimming (from 241bp to 127bp), suggesting higher levels of sequencing artifacts in this sublibrary (@tbl-summary-trimming).

#### Quality Improvements and Technical Considerations

The trimming process revealed interesting patterns across sublibraries. BC_0076 and BC_0080 showed the most pronounced reductions in R1 read length, which may indicate higher initial quality of these libraries requiring more aggressive trimming to remove artifacts while maintaining better overall data integrity.

BC_0076 specifically showed earlier and more prominent polyG artifacts, likely due to reagent depletion during sequencing that led to increased G nucleotide incorporation errors. This phenomenon is common in NovaSeq sequencing runs where the largest libraries may experience reagent exhaustion, resulting in higher error rates and more artifacts that require removal during trimming. Despite these technical challenges, the trimming process successfully mitigated these artifacts, resulting in high-quality data suitable for downstream analysis.

## Recommendations for Future Experiments

The observed size variations between sublibraries highlight the importance of balanced library preparation for optimal sequencing efficiency. Libraries of unequal sizes can lead to differential reagent consumption and varying quality across the flowcell. Future experiments should aim for more balanced library sizes to minimize technical artifacts and ensure consistent quality across all sublibraries.

### STARsolo Analysis and Data Quality Assessment

Our single-cell RNA-seq data was processed using STARsolo, which provided comprehensive quality metrics and mapping statistics. The analysis revealed excellent data quality suitable for investigating division of labor patterns in *P. brassicacearum* populations.

**Sequencing Saturation Explanation:**
Sequencing saturation measures how completely we have sampled the transcriptome. It is calculated as:
```
Saturation = 1 - (N_umi / N_reads)
```
where:
- N_umi = number of unique CB/UMI/gene combinations
- N_reads = number of reads with valid CB/UMI/gene

A saturation of 0.97% indicates we could sequence much deeper to capture more unique molecules.

**Note**: The low unique mapping rates (3.64% to genome, 2.69% to genes) are typical for bacterial RNA-seq due to the compact nature of bacterial genomes with overlapping coding sequences. The high multiple mapping rate reflects the complexity of bacterial transcriptomes, which is particularly relevant for studying division of labor as it captures the full transcriptional landscape.

#### Data Quality Summary for Division of Labor Analysis

The STARsolo results provide strong evidence that our data is well-suited for investigating division of labor in *P. brassicacearum*:

1. **Comprehensive Gene Detection**: 6,035 genes detected across all cells captures the full transcriptional diversity
besoin de verif apres le nombre de genes detectÃ©s par cellules , nombre umi ... mais avant doit filtrer les cellules 
2. **Excellent Technical Quality**: >95% Q30 scores and 85.58% valid barcodes indicate minimal technical noise
3. **Robust Mapping**: 75.64% of reads mapped to genes, providing comprehensive transcriptome coverage

The low sequencing saturation (0.97%) suggests we could potentially sequence deeper to capture more unique molecules, but the current depth is sufficient for robust division of labor analysis. The high proportion of multiple-mapped reads is expected for bacterial data and actually beneficial for capturing the full complexity of overlapping transcriptional units that may be involved in division of labor processes.

#### GeneFull vs Gene Mapping Strategy

We employed the **GeneFull mapping** approach, which includes:
- Coding sequences (CDS)
- Untranslated regions (UTRs) 
- Non-coding RNAs
- Intergenic regions

This broader mapping strategy is particularly valuable for bacterial division of labor studies as it captures regulatory elements, non-coding RNAs, and intergenic regions that may play crucial roles in phenotypic differentiation and specialization within bacterial populations.

Genome and transcriptome description (obtained with fastqc)
:::

The genome and transcriptome composition analysis reveals the distribution of different RNA types in our *P. brassicacearum* samples. This information is crucial for understanding the transcriptional landscape and identifying potential division of labor patterns, as different RNA types may be differentially expressed across subpopulations.






### Cell Filtering Strategy

For our division of labor analysis, we retained all cell barcodes that passed quality control (820,800 barcodes), rather than applying additional filtering thresholds. This approach maximizes our ability to detect rare subpopulations and subtle division of labor patterns that might be missed with more stringent filtering.

**Important Note on STARsolo Default Filtering:**
We deliberately did not use STARsolo's default filtering method (KneePant), which would have resulted in approximately 27,000 cells. This decision was based on the concern that the KneePant method might eliminate stressed cells that could have lower quality metrics compared to non-stressed cells, potentially biasing our division of labor analysis by removing biologically relevant subpopulations.

The choice of filtering strategy is complex and context-dependent. As mentioned in the literature, various filtering approaches exist:
- Filtering based on read types (global or condition-specific thresholds)
- Filtering based on reads per cell
- Filtering based on genes expressed per cell
- Filtering based on reads per gene

In the Kuchina et al. (2021) study, they used a threshold of 200 UMI per cell, but we chose a more inclusive approach to capture the full spectrum of cellular heterogeneity in our *P. brassicacearum* population.

:::

The filtering analysis shows the distribution of UMI counts per cell before and after applying quality thresholds. This visualization helps assess the impact of filtering on our ability to detect division of labor patterns and ensures we maintain sufficient statistical power for downstream analysis.

**Key considerations for division of labor analysis:**
- The choice of filtering threshold can significantly impact the detection of rare subpopulations
- Housekeeping genes and rRNA content may provide insights into growth rate variations across cells
- Technical replicates may need to be pooled or analyzed separately depending on experimental design

In addition, we kept the highest-scored multimapping reads, assigning a fractional count based on the number of equally good alignments, because bacterial genomes are known to contain overlapping coding sequences. We then generated a matrix of gene counts for each cell (N-by-K matrix, with N cells and K genes).
