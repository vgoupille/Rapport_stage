# Results


This chapter presents the findings of our single-cell RNA-seq analysis of *P. brassicacearum* R401, focusing on the division of labor within bacterial populations. To investigate division of labor patterns, we first established robust data quality through comprehensive preprocessing and quality control steps. We then applied appropriate filtering strategies to ensure reliable cell identification and gene expression quantification. These preliminary steps are essential prerequisites that will enable us to characterize the cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional diversity across different experimental conditions to identify potential division of labor mechanisms.

Artifacts content of the sublibrary BC_0076 before and after trimming with Cutadapt and Fastp
:::

*The adapter content analysis shows the presence of various sequencing artifacts in the raw data (example of BC_0076). In the before trimming plot (@fig-before), distinct patterns are visible: polyG stretches (pink), polyA tails (cyan), and Illumina adapter sequences (purple). After trimming (@fig-after), these artifacts are effectively removed, resulting in clean sequence data suitable for downstream analysis. The successful elimination of these technical artifacts demonstrates the effectiveness of the trimming pipeline in improving data quality.*

: Summary of sequence metrics before and after trimming of each sublibrary with Cutadapt and Fastp (R1 read length metrics) {#tbl-summary-trimming layout-ncol="1"}

The trimming process successfully removed various sequencing artifacts and improved data quality for downstream analysis. The preprocessing pipeline eliminated template-switching oligo (TSO) sequences, polyG stretches (NovaSeq-specific artifacts), polyA tails, and adapter sequences from the raw sequencing data (@fig-adaptateur, @tbl-summary-trimming). This cleaning step was essential for accurate gene expression quantification and reliable single-cell analysis.

#### Trimming Efficiency and Data Retention

The trimming process resulted in an average reduction of 25.4% in the total number of sequences across all sublibraries, from 1,733.7 million to 1,284.5 million reads (@tbl-summary-trimming). This reduction rate is within the expected range for single-cell RNA-seq data and indicates effective removal of low-quality sequences while preserving the majority of informative reads. The final dataset of 1.284 billion reads provides substantial sequencing depth for robust analysis.

#### Sub-library Size Variations and Their Implications

The four sublibraries showed notable size differences before trimming, ranging from 325.5 million reads (BC_0077) to 631.4 million reads (BC_0076) (@tbl-summary-trimming). These variations likely reflect differences in library preparation efficiency and sequencing performance across the flowcell. The largest library (BC_0076) exhibited the most significant reduction in read length after trimming (from 241bp to 127bp), suggesting higher levels of sequencing artifacts in this sublibrary (@tbl-summary-trimming).

#### Quality Improvements and Technical Considerations

The trimming process revealed interesting patterns across sublibraries. BC_0076 and BC_0080 showed the most pronounced reductions in R1 read length, which may indicate higher initial quality of these libraries requiring more aggressive trimming to remove artifacts while maintaining better overall data integrity.

BC_0076 specifically showed earlier and more prominent polyG artifacts, likely due to reagent depletion during sequencing that led to increased G nucleotide incorporation errors. This phenomenon is common in NovaSeq sequencing runs where the largest libraries may experience reagent exhaustion, resulting in higher error rates and more artifacts that require removal during trimming. Despite these technical challenges, the trimming process successfully mitigated these artifacts, resulting in high-quality data suitable for downstream analysis.

## Recommendations for Future Experiments

The observed size variations between sublibraries highlight the importance of balanced library preparation for optimal sequencing efficiency. Libraries of unequal sizes can lead to differential reagent consumption and varying quality across the flowcell. Future experiments should aim for more balanced library sizes to minimize technical artifacts and ensure consistent quality across all sublibraries.

### Transcriptome Description after STARsolo processing

Following the successful preprocessing and trimming of our sequencing data, we performed alignment against the reference genome of *P. brassicacearum R401* (@fig-genome). The barcode reading and quantification by STARsolo provided comprehensive quality metrics and mapping statistics.

*Metrics obtained with STARsolo after barcode-UMI reading and alignment with the reference genome of *P. brassicacearum R401*.*

The STARsolo analysis processed the 1.284 billion trimmed reads and successfully identified 1.099 billion reads with valid barcodes (85.58% of total reads), demonstrating excellent barcode quality (@tbl-starsolo-comprehensive). Among these, 81.44% had exact barcode matches and 4.14% had single mismatches, indicating robust cell identification. The sequencing quality was outstanding with Q30 scores above 95% for both RNA reads and barcode/UMI sequences. This high percentage of valid barcodes falls within the expected range of 70-90% for successful experiments, as recommended by Gaisser et al. (2024) (@gaisser2024), indicating excellent library preparation and barcoding efficiency with no significant issues in the protocol optimization.

Gene mapping analysis revealed that 75.64% of reads mapped to genes, with 2.69% showing unique mapping and the remainder showing multiple mapping, which is typical for bacterial genomes with overlapping genes and repeated sequences. The fraction of uniquely aligned reads (2.69%) falls within the expected range of 3-12% for bacterial samples (Gaisser et al. (@gaisser2024)). This value is influenced by the species-specific characteristics and experimental conditions.

A total of 6,035 genes were detected across 699,355 unique cell barcodes, representing 96.6% of the 6,249 genes (@fig-genome) annotated in the *P. brassicacearum R401* genome, with one gene being automatically ignored by STARsolo due to poor annotation.

The sequencing saturation, calculated as:

$$ Sequencing\ Saturation = 1 - \frac{N_{\text{umi}}}{N_{\text{reads with valid barcodes}}} = 1 - \frac{36,565,214}{1,099,327,755} = 0.97\% $$

  - Where:
    - $N_{\text{umi}}$ = number of unique molecules detected, distinct combinations of Cell Barcode (CB) / UMI / gene
    - $N_{\text{reads}}$ = total number of reads with valid CB/UMI/gene combinations
  

::: {.callout-warning}
This very low saturation indicates that we have captured only a small fraction of the total unique molecules in the transcriptome. According to Gaisser et al. (2024) @gaisser2024, a sequencing saturation of <0.5 may indicate that more sequencing is required to capture all barcoded transcripts in the library, with a saturation value of >= 0.7 typically indicating sufficient coverage. Our saturation value of 0.97% falls well below these recommended thresholds, suggesting that **our current sequencing depth may not be sufficient to capture the full complexity of the transcriptome**. While the current sequencing depth of 1.284 billion reads provides substantial coverage, the low saturation indicates that we could potentially benefit from deeper sequencing to capture more unique transcripts and achieve better coverage of the transcriptional landscape.

Compositional analysis of *P. brassicacearum* R401 genome annotation and transcriptome distribution of different RNA types
:::

The genome and transcriptome composition analysis reveals the distribution of different RNA types in our *P. brassicacearum* sample. In the [annotated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/gene/GCA_030064105.1/)  genome of *P. brassicacearum* R401, we identified 6,100 mRNA genes (97.6% of total genes), 65 tRNA genes, 16 rRNA genes (0.3% of the genome) and 68 other genes. However, in the transcriptome analysis of our 36,565,214 UMIs, the distribution shows a different pattern: 57.1% correspond to mRNA transcripts (21 millions), while 28.4% are rRNA transcripts (representing approximately 10 millions UMIs), 10.2 % are tRNA transcripts (representing approximately 4 millions UMIs) and 4.4% are other genes (representing approximately 1.5 millions UMIs). This distribution concords with the well-established observation that rRNA and tRNA transcripts represent a large proportion of the bacterial transcriptome despite constituting only a small fraction of the genome, due to their high transcriptional activity and stability @nishimura2025.

STARsolo detected 699,355 out of 820,800 possible barcode combinations. Given that our sublibrary was designed to target approximately 3,000 cells, the observed number of barcodes is within the expected range. The presence of additional barcodes likely represents contamination that can occur throughout the protocol, including potential contamination in the source oligonucleotide plates. To identify genuine cells among the total barcode population, STARsolo employs a knee plot strategy (see supplementary data for associated results). As recommended in the literature (Gaisser et al. (2024) @gaisser2024), we chose to apply our own filtering criteria rather than using STARsolo's default KneePant method, which would have resulted in approximately 27,000 cells. This decision was based on the concern that the KneePant method might eliminate stressed cells that could have lower quality metrics compared to non-stressed cells, potentially biasing our division of labor analysis by removing biologically relevant subpopulations. 

Despite the low sequencing depth indicated by the saturation value, we will assess whether the signal is sufficient for division of labor analysis. However, before proceeding with this assessment, it is necessary to filter the barcodes to retain only genuine cells, as the current dataset contains a large number of contaminating barcodes that could mask the biological signal of interest.

Single-cell RNA-seq analysis results showing gene expression patterns and cellular heterogeneity in *P. brassicacearum* populations
:::

*The single-cell analysis reveals distinct gene expression patterns across different cell populations within the *P. brassicacearum* culture. The dot plot (@fig-dotplot) shows both the average expression level and the percentage of cells expressing each gene, providing insights into gene expression prevalence across the population. The heatmap visualization (@fig-heatmap) displays gene expression patterns across different cell clusters, revealing potential subpopulations with distinct transcriptional profiles.*

*The violin plots (@fig-violin-sc) demonstrate the distribution of gene expression levels, highlighting cellular heterogeneity in transcriptional activity. Gene clustering analysis (@fig-gene-cluster) identifies groups of genes with similar expression patterns, suggesting coordinated transcriptional regulation. These results demonstrate significant cellular heterogeneity in gene expression within the *P. brassicacearum* population, providing evidence for potential division of labor mechanisms where different cells may specialize in different functions based on their transcriptional profiles.*
