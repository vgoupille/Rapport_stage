Artifacts content of the sublibrary BC_0076 before and after trimming with Cutadapt and Fastp
:::

*The adapter content analysis shows the presence of various sequencing artifacts in the raw data (example of BC_0076). In the before trimming plot (@fig-before), distinct patterns are visible: polyG stretches (pink), polyA tails (cyan), and Illumina adapter sequences (purple). After trimming (@fig-after), these artifacts are effectively removed, resulting in clean sequence data suitable for downstream analysis. The successful elimination of these technical artifacts demonstrates the effectiveness of the trimming pipeline in improving data quality.*

#### Trimming Efficiency and Data Retention

The trimming process successfully removed various sequencing artifacts and improved data quality for downstream analysis. The preprocessing pipeline eliminated template-switching oligo (TSO) sequences, polyG stretches (NovaSeq-specific artifacts), polyA tails, and adapter sequences from the raw sequencing data (@fig-adaptateur, @tbl-summary-trimming). This cleaning step was essential for accurate gene expression quantification and reliable single-cell analysis. The trimming process resulted in an average reduction of 25.4% in the total number of sequences across all sublibraries, from 1,733.7 million to 1,284.5 million reads (@tbl-summary-trimming). This reduction rate is within the expected range for single-cell RNA-seq data and indicates effective removal of low-quality sequences while preserving the majority of informative reads.

#### Sub-library Size Variations and Technical Considerations

The four sublibraries showed notable size differences before trimming, ranging from 325.5 million reads (BC_0077) to 631.4 million reads (BC_0076) (@tbl-summary-trimming). These variations likely reflect differences in library preparation efficiency and sequencing performance across the flowcell. The largest library (BC_0076) exhibited the most significant reduction in read length after trimming (from 241bp to 127bp), suggesting higher levels of sequencing artifacts in this sublibrary.

BC_0076 specifically showed earlier and more prominent polyG artifacts, likely due to reagent depletion during sequencing that led to increased G nucleotide incorporation errors. This phenomenon is common in NovaSeq sequencing runs where the largest libraries may experience reagent exhaustion, resulting in higher error rates and more artifacts that require removal during trimming. Despite these technical challenges, the trimming process successfully mitigated these artifacts, resulting in high-quality data suitable for downstream analysis.

### Transcriptome Description after STARsolo processing

Following the successful preprocessing and trimming of our sequencing data, we performed alignment against the reference genome of *P. brassicacearum R401* (@fig-genome). The barcode reading and quantification by STARsolo provided comprehensive quality metrics and mapping statistics.

#### Barcode Quality and Cell Identification

The STARsolo analysis processed the 1.284 billion trimmed reads and successfully identified 1.099 billion reads with valid barcodes (85.58% of total reads), demonstrating excellent barcode quality (@tbl-starsolo-comprehensive). Among these, 81.44% had exact barcode matches and 4.14% had single mismatches, indicating robust cell identification. The sequencing quality was outstanding with Q30 scores above 95% for both RNA reads and barcode/UMI sequences. This high percentage of valid barcodes falls within the expected range of 70-90% for successful experiments, as recommended by Gaisser et al. (2024) @gaisser2024, indicating excellent library preparation and barcoding efficiency.

#### Gene Mapping and Detection

Gene mapping analysis revealed that 75.64% of reads mapped to genes, with 2.69% showing unique mapping and the remainder showing multiple mapping, which is typical for bacterial genomes with overlapping genes and repeated sequences. The fraction of uniquely aligned reads (2.69%) falls within the expected range of 3-12% for bacterial samples @gaisser2024. A total of 6,035 genes were detected across 699,355 unique cell barcodes, representing 96.6% of the 6,249 genes (@fig-genome) annotated in the *P. brassicacearum R401* genome.

#### Sequencing Saturation and Coverage Assessment

The sequencing saturation, calculated as:

$$ Sequencing\ Saturation = 1 - \frac{N_{\text{umi}}}{N_{\text{reads with valid barcodes}}} = 1 - \frac{36,565,214}{1,099,327,755} = 0.97 $$

-   Where:
    -   $N_{\text{umi}}$ = number of unique molecules detected, distinct combinations of Cell Barcode (CB) / UMI / gene
    -   $N_{\text{reads}}$ = total number of reads with valid CB/UMI/gene combinations

This high saturation value of 0.97 could indicate either excellent transcriptome coverage or technical artifacts. While a saturation of \>= 0.7 typically indicates sufficient coverage according to Gaisser et al. (2024) @gaisser2024, such high values may also result from technical issues including: (1) inefficient RNA capture leading to limited transcript diversity, (2) PCR amplification bias concentrating reads on few UMIs. The interpretation of this saturation value should be considered alongside other quality metrics such as UMIs per cell and genes detected to distinguish between biological reality and technical artifacts.

Compositional analysis of *P. brassicacearum* R401 genome annotation and transcriptome distribution of different RNA types
:::

#### Genome and Transcriptome Composition

The genome and transcriptome composition analysis reveals the distribution of different RNA types in our *P. brassicacearum* sample (@fig-genome-transcriptome). In the [annotated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/gene/GCA_030064105.1/) genome of *P. brassicacearum* R401, we identified 6,100 mRNA genes (97.6% of total genes), 65 tRNA genes (1.1% of total genes), 16 rRNA genes (0.3%) and 68 other genes. However, in the transcriptome analysis of our 36,565,214 UMIs, the distribution shows a different pattern: 57.1% correspond to mRNA transcripts (21 millions), while 28.4% are rRNA transcripts (representing approximately 10 millions UMIs), 10.2% are tRNA transcripts (representing approximately 4 millions UMIs) and 4.4% are other genes (representing approximately 1.5 millions UMIs). This distribution concords with the well-established observation that rRNA and tRNA transcripts represent a large proportion of the bacterial transcriptome despite constituting only a small fraction of the genome, due to their high transcriptional activity and stability @nishimura2025.

#### Cell Barcode Detection and Filtering Strategy

STARsolo detected 699,355 out of 820,800 possible barcode combinations. Given that our sublibrary was designed to target approximately 3,000 cells, the observed number of barcodes is within the expected range. The presence of additional barcodes likely represents contamination that can occur throughout the protocol, including potential contamination in the source oligonucleotide plates.

To identify genuine cells among the total barcode population, STARsolo employs a knee plot strategy[@luecken2019]. As recommended in the literature (Gaisser et al. 2024 @gaisser2024), we chose to apply our own filtering criteria rather than using STARsolo's default KneePant method, which would have resulted in approximately 27,000 cells. This decision was based on the concern that the KneePant method might eliminate stressed cells that could have lower quality metrics compared to non-stressed cells, potentially biasing our division of labor analysis by removing biologically relevant subpopulations.

The high sequencing saturation value of 0.97 requires careful interpretation, as it could reflect either excellent transcriptome coverage or technical artifacts. Before proceeding with division of labor analysis, we will assess this value alongside other quality metrics and filter the barcodes to retain only genuine cells, as the current dataset contains a large number of contaminating barcodes that could mask the biological signal of interest.

## Cell quality filtering and dataset characterization {#sec-global-filtering}

Following the initial UMI-based filtering (see @sec-appendix-cell-filtering), which revealed clear differences between culture conditions with M9 medium (nutrient-limited) showing fewer retained barcodes compared to M9F (nutrient-rich), additional quality control steps were applied including doublet removal, biological replicate-based filtering, and mRNA type filtering. The final dataset contained approximately 3,000 cells, representing the highest-quality cells selected from each biological replicate to ensure balanced representation across experimental conditions.

The filtering by biological replicate shows that some technical replicates were partially or completely eliminated to retain only the best-performing ones. The distribution of retained cells shows approximately 160 cells per biological replicate (@fig-splitplot-barcodes-final). When few technical replicate categories remain for a biological replicate, it indicates high variability between technical replicates, likely due to differential barcode efficiency since each technical replicate possesses different barcode 1 combinations (@fig-splitplot-barcodes-final). Some technical replicates were more efficient than others (e.g., M9F A sampling T2 had one technical replicate that was much more efficient than its group and therefore almost the only one for which cells passed the filter). Following this filtering, technical replicates are no longer considered for subsequent analyses, and we focus on the biological replicate level.

The following visualizations also show the distribution of mRNA gene expression patterns across the filtered cell population, specifically the number of mRNA genes detected per cell and the number of UMIs associated with mRNA genes per cell @fig-filtered_mRNA_violin_UMI, @fig-filtered_mRNA_violin_gene, @fig-scatter_final.

Metrics of filtered cells across experimental conditions (Culture Medium × Biological Replicate × Sampling Time) in the single-cell RNA-seq experiment.
:::

M9F medium consistently showed higher values compared to M9 (@fig-scatter_final), with mean mRNA counts of 749 for M9F versus 372 for M9, and mean gene counts of 462 for M9F versus 270 for M9.

Biological replicate variability was particularly pronounced at T1 for both conditions and at T3 for M9 conditions @fig-filtered_mRNA_violin_UMI, @fig-filtered_mRNA_violin_gene. Under nutrient-limited conditions (M9), cells showed markedly reduced transcriptional activity at T2 and T3 timepoints, with some replicates displaying very low UMI and gene counts, suggesting either reduced cellular activity or technical challenges in recovering stressed cells. The scatter plot (@fig-scatter_final) reveals a strong positive correlation between UMI counts and mRNA gene numbers, confirming the quality of the filtered dataset and the relationship between sequencing depth and gene detection.

These results demonstrate that the filtering strategy effectively removed poor-quality barcodes to retain only potential "real cells" from each biological replicate that can be analyzed for downstream investigation.

## Dimensionality Reduction and Transcriptional Heterogeneity Analysis

Following the quality filtering steps, we performed dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis to explore transcriptional heterogeneity across cell populations and assess global differences between culture conditions. The analysis began with data transformation using the Bacsc method (see @fig-pca-choose for detailed about it), followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the optimal number of dimensions for downstream analysis. UMAP visualization and clustering were then used to detect global transcriptional differences between experimental conditions.

### Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) results showing transcriptional heterogeneity and gene contribution patterns in *P. brassicacearum* populations
:::

The PCA analysis revealed a characteristic pattern of low variance explained by individual principal components (@fig-pca-choose), which is typical for bacterial single-cell RNA-seq data, particularly under stress conditions. PC1 captured approximately 0.6% of the total variance and dominated the other components, which showed even lower contributions.

PC1 successfully distinguished between the two culture conditions (M9 and M9F), revealing distinct transcriptional patterns (@fig-pca-condition). In fact, we can see that M9 T2 and M9 T3 samples (brown and purple points in the Sampling Time facet, top right) were clearly separated from other conditions, while M9 T1 showed no significant difference from M9F conditions. We can also abserve this on the heatmaps (@fig-pca1-summary-top). This suggests that cells in M9 medium at T1 may not yet be experiencing stress, possibly due to residual iron availability in the medium at this early timepoint.

Notably, M9 samples positioned on the left side of PC1 showed greater dispersion compared to those on the right. Furthermore, PC1 axis alignment followed a gradient of total mRNA concentration per cell, suggesting that this component primarily captures differences in overall transcriptional activity between conditions.

#### Gene Contribution Analysis to PC1

The heatmap analysis with z-score scaling (ranging from 0 to 1) revealed the genes contributing most significantly to PC1 variance (@fig-pca1-summary-top). Each row represents a gene and each column represents a cell, with the legend at the bottom corresponding to biological replicates.

The genes contributing most to PC1 variance were primarily associated with translational regulation and iron metabolism, reflecting the stress response to iron limitation in M9 medium. Among the translational regulators, we identified rpsA (30S ribosomal protein S1), raiA (ribosome-associated translation inhibitor), and htpG (HSP90 protein chaperone). HtpG, as a molecular chaperone, plays an indirect but essential role in the biosynthesis and functionality of siderophores. For example, HtpG facilitates the correct folding and stability of enzymes involved in siderophore synthesis, such as those participating in yersiniabactine production in *Yersinia* species [@mangla].

Notably, porphobilinogen synthase was also identified among the top 20 genes contributing to PC1 variance. This finding is particularly relevant given our experimental design using iron-limited M9 medium. In bacteria, the link between porphobilinogen (PBG) and iron is essential for heme synthesis, a cofactor indispensable for many proteins involved in metabolism, cellular respiration, and electron transport. The biosynthesis of heme in bacteria follows a pathway similar to eukaryotes, with PBG being a key intermediate formed by the condensation of two delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) molecules, catalyzed by porphobilinogen synthase. This process is regulated by iron availability in bacterial cells [@choby2016]. The differential expression of porphobilinogen synthase between M9 and M9F conditions thus reflects the cellular adaptation to iron stress.

The analysis also identified TonB-dependent siderophore receptors, which are essential for high-affinity iron acquisition in gram-negative bacteria. These outer membrane-localized proteins bind iron chelates at the cell surface and promote their uptake [@moeck1998; @fujita2019]. Together with porphobilinogen synthase, these genes form a coherent transcriptional response to iron limitation, explaining the clear separation of M9 conditions along PC1.

While PC1 primarily captured differences in transcriptional activity and stress response, PC2 revealed distinct patterns related to cellular motility and chemotaxis (@fig-pca2-summary-top). For example, methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) and flagellin genes were identified as major contributors to PC2 variance, suggesting a role in chemotaxis and motility responses to environmental conditions.

<!-- Additional genes contributing to PC1 variance included thiolase II and HMG-CoA synthase, which play crucial roles in abiotic stress response, particularly oxidative stress. These enzymes are involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway, essential for producing antioxidant compounds that protect bacterial cells against oxidative damage. -->

#### UMAP, Clustering Analysis and Differential Expression Analysis

Following the dimensionality reduction analysis, we compared the transcriptional profiles between the two culture conditions (M9 and M9F) to identify potential division of labor mechanisms.

Single-cell RNA-seq analysis results showing gene expression patterns and cellular heterogeneity in *P. brassicacearum* populations
:::

*The single-cell analysis reveals distinct gene expression patterns across different cell populations within the* P. brassicacearum\* culture. The dot plot (@fig-dotplot) shows both the average expression level and the percentage of cells expressing each gene, providing insights into gene expression prevalence across the population. The heatmap visualization (@fig-heatmap) displays gene expression patterns across different cell clusters, revealing potential subpopulations with distinct transcriptional profiles.\*

*The violin plots (@fig-violin-sc) demonstrate the distribution of gene expression levels, highlighting cellular heterogeneity in transcriptional activity. Gene clustering analysis (@fig-gene-cluster) identifies groups of genes with similar expression patterns, suggesting coordinated transcriptional regulation. These results demonstrate significant cellular heterogeneity in gene expression within the* P. brassicacearum\* population, providing evidence for potential division of labor mechanisms where different cells may specialize in different functions based on their transcriptional profiles.\*
