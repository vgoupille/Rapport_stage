The M9 medium represents low nutrient conditions with minimal glucose and iron concentrations, while M9F medium provides high nutrient availability with elevated glucose and iron levels.

## Trimming pipeline steps {#sec-appendix-trimming-steps}

The following steps were performed sequentially for read trimming, as implemented in the custom pipeline (see process_sample.sh). Each step is performed in paired-end mode to maintain synchronization between R1 and R2 files.

1. **TSO trimming (Cutadapt):**  
   Removal of template-switching oligo (TSO) sequences from R1 using Cutadapt. This step targets TSO sequences at the 5' end of cDNA reads to eliminate technical artifacts.
   ```bash
   cutadapt -j ${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK} \
       -g "AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGAATGGG; min_overlap=6; max_errors=0.2" \
       -g "CAGAGTGAATGGG; min_overlap=6; max_errors=0.2" \
       --pair-filter=both \
       -m 20: \
       --too-short-output "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_R1_too_short.fastq.gz" \
       --too-short-paired-output "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_R2_too_short.fastq.gz" \
       -o "${r1_output}" \
       -p "${r2_output}" \
       "${r1_input}" "${r2_input}" \
       --report=full \
       --json "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_stats.json"
   ```

2. **Initial quality and adapter trimming (Fastp):**  
   Removal of low-quality bases, polyG/polyX tails, and adapter sequences using Fastp. This step also removes the TruSeq Read 2 adapter and I7 adapter at the end of R1 if present.
   ```bash
   fastp \
       -i "${r1_input}" \
       -I "${r2_input}" \
       -o "${r1_output}" \
       -O "${r2_output}" \
       --html "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_report.html" \
       --json "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_report.json" \
       --report_title "microSplit Initial Fastp Report - ${sample_name}" \
       --compression 4 \
       --verbose \
       --unpaired1 "${unpaired1}" \
       --unpaired2 "${unpaired2}" \
       --length_required 91 \
       --dont_overwrite \
       --trim_front1 0 \
       --trim_front2 0 \
       --trim_tail1 0 \
       --trim_tail2 0 \
       --trim_poly_g \
       --poly_g_min_len 10 \
       --trim_poly_x \
       --poly_x_min_len 12 \
       --detect_adapter_for_pe \
       --adapter_sequence=ATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTGA \
       --adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC
   ```

3. **PolyA trimming (Cutadapt):**  
   Removal of polyA stretches (>=12 nt) and all downstream sequences from R1 using Cutadapt, targeting polyA sequences introduced during library preparation. This step cleans reads with short cDNA that extend into the R2 complementary region, using polyA as a repeat sequence (read_polyA from the library).
   ```bash
   cutadapt -j ${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK} \
       -a "A{12}; min_overlap=12; max_errors=0.2" \
       --pair-filter=both \
       -m 20: \
       --too-short-output "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_R1_too_short.fastq.gz" \
       --too-short-paired-output "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_R2_too_short.fastq.gz" \
       -o "${r1_output}" \
       -p "${r2_output}" \
       "${r1_input}" "${r2_input}" \
       --report=full \
       --json "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_stats.json"
   ```
   This step trims polyA15 and longer stretches that may remain after the previous steps.

4. **Specific adapter trimming (Cutadapt):**  
   Removal of the specific adapter sequence CCACAGTCTCAAGCAC from R1 using Cutadapt (corresponds to the round 2 linker sequence). This step uses the round 2 linker barcode as a reference point and eliminates everything behind it, particularly useful for cleaning random hexamer sequences with short cDNA that extend into R2 complementary sequences.
   ```bash
   cutadapt -j ${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK} \
       -a "CCACAGTCTCAAGCAC; min_overlap=6; max_errors=0.1" \
       --pair-filter=both \
       -m 20: \
       --too-short-output "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_R1_too_short.fastq.gz" \
       --too-short-paired-output "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_R2_too_short.fastq.gz" \
       -o "${r1_output}" \
       -p "${r2_output}" \
       "${r1_input}" "${r2_input}" \
       --report=full \
       --json "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_stats.json"
   ```

5. **Linker and additional adapter trimming (Cutadapt):**  
   Removal of linker and additional adapter sequences from R1 using Cutadapt, to further clean the reads. This includes TruSeq Read 2 adapter (AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA), Round 3 linker (AGTCGTACGCCGATGCGAAACATCGGCCAC), and Round 2 linker (CCACAGTCTCAAGCACGTGGAT).  
   This step ensures that any remaining linker or adapter sequences are removed for certain libraries.
   ```bash
   cutadapt -j ${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK} \
       -a "CCACAGTCTCAAGCACGTGGAT; min_overlap=6; max_errors=0.2" \
       -a "AGTCGTACGCCGATGCGAAACATCGGCCAC; min_overlap=6; max_errors=0.2" \
       -a "AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA; min_overlap=6; max_errors=0.2" \
       --pair-filter=both \
       -m 20: \
       --too-short-output "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_R1_too_short.fastq.gz" \
       --too-short-paired-output "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_R2_too_short.fastq.gz" \
       -o "${r1_output}" \
       -p "${r2_output}" \
       "${r1_input}" "${r2_input}" \
       --report=full \
       --json "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_stats.json"
   ```

6. **Final quality and length filtering (Fastp):**  
   Final trimming with Fastp, including additional adapter removal, trimming of fixed bases from the 5' and 3' ends, and filtering for minimum read length to ensure high-quality output for downstream analysis.  
   This step trims R1 at both 5' and 3' ends to keep only cDNA and ensure clean sequences for downstream analysis.
   ```bash
   fastp \
       -i "${r1_input}" \
       -I "${r2_input}" \
       -o "${r1_output}" \
       -O "${r2_output}" \
       --trim_front1 10 \
       --trim_front2 0 \
       --trim_tail1 16 \
       --trim_tail2 0 \
       --length_required 25 \
       --detect_adapter_for_pe \
       --adapter_sequence=AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGAATGGG \
       --adapter_sequence=CCACAGTCTCAAGCACGTGGAT \
       --adapter_sequence=AGTCGTACGCCGATGCGAAACATCGGCCAC \
       --adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA \
       --html "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_report.html" \
       --json "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_report.json" \
       --report_title "microSplit Final Fastp Report - ${sample_name}" \
       --compression 4 \
       --verbose
   ```

: STARsolo KneePant filtering results for comparison {#tbl-starsolo-kneepant}

*Results obtained using STARsolo's default KneePant filtering method. This approach would have resulted in approximately 27,000 cells with higher average coverage per cell, but potentially at the cost of removing biologically relevant stressed cells that might exhibit lower quality metrics. In contrast, our custom filtering approach was specifically designed to target approximately 3,000 high-quality cells across all experimental conditions, prioritizing balanced representation of each condition*

The KneePant method applies a knee plot analysis to identify the inflection point in the barcode rank plot, automatically determining the threshold between genuine cells and background noise. While this method provides a standardized approach to cell filtering, it may not be optimal for division of labor analysis where stressed cells with potentially lower quality metrics could represent important biological subpopulations. Our targeted approach of ~3,000 cells ensures sufficient statistical power for differential expression analysis while maintaining balanced representation across all experimental conditions (2 media × 3 biological replicates × 3 timepoints).













## Initial filtering with minimum 100 UMI per cell{#sec-appendix-cell-filtering}


To ensure data quality and remove technical artifacts while preserving biological variation, we implemented a multi-step filtering strategy. The first step involved filtering cells based on unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts.

::: {#fig-filter_100UMI layout="[[1,1], [1]] "}

Filtering of low-quality cell barcodes with fewer than 100 UMIs per cell across all biological replicates in the single-cell RNA-seq experiment.
:::

*The initial filtering step removed cell barcodes with fewer than 100 UMIs to eliminate artifacts. This threshold was chosen to remove very low-quality barcodes and to demonstrate clear differences in UMI distributions between the two culture conditions (M9 vs M9F), with M9 losing more BCs at this threshold, while also serving as a quality control metric to identify potentially failed technical replicates. The filtering revealed significant heterogeneity between conditions, with M9 medium showing fewer retained barcodes compared to M9F. This difference could reflect lower transcriptional activity under nutrient-limited conditions, but may also be related to other factors such as cell wall modifications affecting permeabilization efficiency, or increased cell death leading to differential recovery during washing steps. Additionally, technical replicates showed varying sensitivity to filtering, indicating heterogeneity in the ability to recover reads across different experimental batches. Notably, one technical replicate (replicate 3 of M9_C at T3) appeared to have failed, likely due to a pipetting error, and was consequently eliminated by this threshold.*

## Global filtering of high quality cells {#sec-appendix-global-filtering}

Following the initial UMI-based filtering, additional quality control steps were applied including doublet removal, biological replicate-based filtering, and transcript type filtering. The final dataset contained approximately 3,000 high-quality cells suitable for downstream analysis.

After transcript type filtering, only mRNA genes were retained for analysis, excluding ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and other non-coding RNA species. Additionally, genes expressed in fewer than 5 cells across the entire dataset were removed to eliminate low-quality or spurious gene detection events. The following visualizations show the distribution of mRNA gene expression patterns across the filtered cell population, specifically the number of mRNA genes detected per cell and the number of UMIs associated with mRNA genes per cell.

Final filtering of high quality cells across all biological replicates in the single-cell RNA-seq experiment.

:::

*Final filtering results demonstrate the successful removal of low-efficiency technical replicates, resulting in a more uniform distribution (no longer bimodal) with approximately 160 cells per condition. Both mRNA genes and UMI counts for mRNA genes show higher values for M9F culture medium compared to M9, reflecting the nutrient-rich conditions. Importantly, biological replicate variability is high at T1 for both culture conditions (M9 and M9F), and also at T3 for M9 conditions, with M9 replicates (stress conditions with limited iron) showing very low counts or gene numbers for T2 and T3 timepoints, suggesting reduced transcriptional activity under nutrient-limited conditions.*
