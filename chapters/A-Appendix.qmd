## MicroSPLiT sequencing library preparation

![MicroSPLiT sequencing library preparation. a, Selected sub-libraries with barcoded cells are lysed. Because cDNA molecules primed with both random hexamer and poly-dT primers undergo the same downstream reactions, only one of them is shown for clarity. b, After lysis, cDNA is purified via streptavidin beads. The cells then undergo an additional RT and template switching step. The template switch primer has two RNA G bases and a locked nucleic acid G base (‘rGrG+G’) sequence to facilitate the binding. c, cDNA is amplified, and size is selected to eliminate the unwanted short product (‘dimer’) from the cDNA amplification product. At this point, the size and concentration of the cDNA product are quantified (Part 2, Step 127). d, The library then undergoes fragmentation and adapter ligation. The desired sequencing product containing the barcodes is amplified with the primers for both the third barcode adapter and the ligation adapter, which contain Read 1 (R1) and Read 2 (R2) sequences. Illumina P5 and P7 sequence adapters and a final sub-library index are also appended at this final PCR step . e, A 0.5–0.7× double size selection then selects out unwanted fragments. The final product’s concentration and size are measured before sequencing .](../figures/protocol_p2.png){#fig-protocol-p2 fig-alt="MicroSPLiT sequencing library preparation" fig-cap="MicroSPLiT sequencing library preparation."}

## Trimming pipeline steps {#sec-appendix-trimming-steps}

The following steps were performed sequentially for read trimming, as implemented in the custom pipeline (see process_sample.sh). Each step is performed in paired-end mode to maintain synchronization between R1 and R2 files.

1. **TSO trimming (Cutadapt):**  
   Removal of template-switching oligo (TSO) sequences from R1 using Cutadapt. This step targets TSO sequences at the 5' end of cDNA reads to eliminate technical artifacts.
   ```bash
   cutadapt -j ${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK} \
       -g "AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGAATGGG; min_overlap=6; max_errors=0.2" \
       -g "CAGAGTGAATGGG; min_overlap=6; max_errors=0.2" \
       --pair-filter=both \
       -m 20: \
       --too-short-output "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_R1_too_short.fastq.gz" \
       --too-short-paired-output "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_R2_too_short.fastq.gz" \
       -o "${r1_output}" \
       -p "${r2_output}" \
       "${r1_input}" "${r2_input}" \
       --report=full \
       --json "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_stats.json"
   ```

2. **Initial quality and adapter trimming (Fastp):**  
   Removal of low-quality bases, polyG/polyX tails, and adapter sequences using Fastp. This step also removes the TruSeq Read 2 adapter and I7 adapter at the end of R1 if present.
   ```bash
   fastp \
       -i "${r1_input}" \
       -I "${r2_input}" \
       -o "${r1_output}" \
       -O "${r2_output}" \
       --html "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_report.html" \
       --json "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_report.json" \
       --report_title "microSplit Initial Fastp Report - ${sample_name}" \
       --compression 4 \
       --verbose \
       --unpaired1 "${unpaired1}" \
       --unpaired2 "${unpaired2}" \
       --length_required 91 \
       --dont_overwrite \
       --trim_front1 0 \
       --trim_front2 0 \
       --trim_tail1 0 \
       --trim_tail2 0 \
       --trim_poly_g \
       --poly_g_min_len 10 \
       --trim_poly_x \
       --poly_x_min_len 12 \
       --detect_adapter_for_pe \
       --adapter_sequence=ATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTGA \
       --adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC
   ```

3. **PolyA trimming (Cutadapt):**  
   Removal of polyA stretches (≥12 nt) from R1 using Cutadapt, targeting polyA sequences introduced during library preparation.
   ```bash
   cutadapt -j ${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK} \
       -a "A{12}; min_overlap=12; max_errors=0.2" \
       --pair-filter=both \
       -m 20: \
       --too-short-output "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_R1_too_short.fastq.gz" \
       --too-short-paired-output "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_R2_too_short.fastq.gz" \
       -o "${r1_output}" \
       -p "${r2_output}" \
       "${r1_input}" "${r2_input}" \
       --report=full \
       --json "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_stats.json"
   ```
   This step trims polyA15 and longer stretches that may remain after the previous steps.

4. **Specific adapter trimming (Cutadapt):**  
   Removal of the specific adapter sequence CCACAGTCTCAAGCAC from R1 using Cutadapt (corresponds to the linker sequence).
   ```bash
   cutadapt -j ${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK} \
       -a "CCACAGTCTCAAGCAC; min_overlap=6; max_errors=0.1" \
       --pair-filter=both \
       -m 20: \
       --too-short-output "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_R1_too_short.fastq.gz" \
       --too-short-paired-output "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_R2_too_short.fastq.gz" \
       -o "${r1_output}" \
       -p "${r2_output}" \
       "${r1_input}" "${r2_input}" \
       --report=full \
       --json "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_stats.json"
   ```

5. **Linker and additional adapter trimming (Cutadapt):**  
   Removal of linker and additional adapter sequences (e.g., CCACAGTCTCAAGCACGTGGAT, AGTCGTACGCCGATGCGAAACATCGGCCAC, AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA) from R1 using Cutadapt, to further clean the reads.  
   This step ensures that any remaining linker or adapter sequences are removed for certain libraries.
   ```bash
   cutadapt -j ${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK} \
       -a "CCACAGTCTCAAGCACGTGGAT; min_overlap=6; max_errors=0.2" \
       -a "AGTCGTACGCCGATGCGAAACATCGGCCAC; min_overlap=6; max_errors=0.2" \
       -a "AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA; min_overlap=6; max_errors=0.2" \
       --pair-filter=both \
       -m 20: \
       --too-short-output "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_R1_too_short.fastq.gz" \
       --too-short-paired-output "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_R2_too_short.fastq.gz" \
       -o "${r1_output}" \
       -p "${r2_output}" \
       "${r1_input}" "${r2_input}" \
       --report=full \
       --json "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_stats.json"
   ```

6. **Final quality and length filtering (Fastp):**  
   Final trimming with Fastp, including additional adapter removal, trimming of fixed bases from the 5' and 3' ends, and filtering for minimum read length to ensure high-quality output for downstream analysis.  
   This step trims R1 at the end to keep only cDNA.
   ```bash
   fastp \
       -i "${r1_input}" \
       -I "${r2_input}" \
       -o "${r1_output}" \
       -O "${r2_output}" \
       --trim_front1 10 \
       --trim_front2 0 \
       --trim_tail1 16 \
       --trim_tail2 0 \
       --length_required 25 \
       --detect_adapter_for_pe \
       --adapter_sequence=AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGAATGGG \
       --adapter_sequence=CCACAGTCTCAAGCACGTGGAT \
       --adapter_sequence=AGTCGTACGCCGATGCGAAACATCGGCCAC \
       --adapter_sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA \
       --html "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_report.html" \
       --json "${output_dir}/${sample_name}_report.json" \
       --report_title "microSplit Final Fastp Report - ${sample_name}" \
       --compression 4 \
       --verbose
   ```

Each step is performed in paired-end mode to ensure synchronization between R1 and R2 files. See the pipeline script for implementation details.
